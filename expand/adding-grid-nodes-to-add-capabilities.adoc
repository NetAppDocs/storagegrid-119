You can add redundancy or additional capabilities to a StorageGRID system by adding new grid nodes to existing sites.

For example, you might choose to add Gateway Nodes to use in a high availability (HA) group, or you might add an Admin Node at a remote site to permit monitoring using a local node.

You can add one or more of the following types of nodes to one or more existing sites in a single expansion operation:

* Non-primary Admin Nodes
* Storage Nodes
* Gateway Nodes

When preparing to add grid nodes, be aware of the following limitations:

* The primary Admin Node is deployed during the initial installation. You can't add a primary Admin Node during an expansion.
* You can add Storage Nodes and other types of nodes in the same expansion.
* When adding Storage Nodes, you must carefully plan the number and location of the new nodes. See link:../expand/guidelines-for-adding-object-capacity.html[Guidelines for adding object capacity].
* If the *Set new node default* option is *Untrusted* on the Untrusted Client Networks tab on the Firewall control page, client applications that connect to expansion nodes using the Client Network must connect using a load balancer endpoint port (*CONFIGURATION* > *Security* > *Firewall control*). See the instructions to link:../admin/configure-firewall-controls.html[change the security setting for the new node] and to link:../admin/configuring-load-balancer-endpoints.html[configure load balancer endpoints].

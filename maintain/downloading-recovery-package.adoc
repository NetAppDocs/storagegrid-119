The Recovery Package file allows you to restore the StorageGRID system if a failure occurs.

* You have the provisioning passphrase.
* You have link:../admin/admin-group-permissions.html[specific access permissions].

The download starts immediately.

. When the download completes, open the `.zip` file and confirm that you can access the contents, including the `Passwords.txt` file.
. Copy the downloaded Recovery Package file (`.zip`) to two safe, secure, and separate locations.
+
CAUTION: The Recovery Package file must be secured because it contains encryption keys and passwords that can be used to obtain data from the StorageGRID system.

To determine if a site can be decommissioned, start by accessing the Decommission Site wizard.

.Before you begin

* You have obtained all required materials.
* You have reviewed the considerations for removing a site.
* You are signed in to the Grid Manager using a link:../admin/web-browser-requirements.html[supported web browser].
* You have the link:../admin/admin-group-permissions.html[Root access permission or the Maintenance and ILM permissions].

.Steps

. Select *MAINTENANCE* > *Tasks* > *Decommission*.
. Select *Decommission Site*.
+
Step 1 (Select Site) of the Decommission Site wizard appears. This step includes an alphabetic list of the sites in your StorageGRID system.
+

. View the values in the *Used Storage Capacity* column to determine how much storage is currently being used for object data at each site.
+
The Used Storage Capacity is an estimate. If nodes are offline, the Used Storage Capacity is the last known value for the site.

 ** For a connected site decommission, this value represents how much object data will need to be moved to other sites or deleted by ILM before you can safely decommission this site.
 ** For a disconnected site decommission, this value represents how much of your system's data storage will become inaccessible when you decommission this site.
+
NOTE: If your ILM policy was designed to protect against the loss of a single site, copies of your object data should still exist on the remaining sites.

. Review the reasons in the *Decommission Possible* column to determine which sites can be decommissioned currently.
+
NOTE: If there is more than one reason a site can't be decommissioned, the most critical reason is shown.

|You can decommission this site.
|Go to <<decommission_possible,the next step>>.

|No. This site contains the primary Admin Node.
|You can't decommission a site containing the primary Admin Node.
|None. You can't perform this procedure.

|No. This site contains one or more Archive Nodes.
|You can't decommission a site containing an Archive Node.
|None. You can't perform this procedure.

|No. All nodes at this site are disconnected. Contact your NetApp account representative.
|You can't perform a connected site decommission unless every node in the site is connected (image:../media/icon_alert_green_checkmark.png[Icon Alert Green check mark]).
|If you want to perform a disconnected site decommission, you must contact your NetApp account representative, who will review your requirements and enable the rest of the Decommission Site wizard.

*IMPORTANT*: Never take online nodes offline so that you can remove a site. You will lose data.

The example shows a StorageGRID system with three sites. The green check mark (image:../media/icon_alert_green_checkmark.png[Icon Alert Green check mark]) for the Raleigh and Sunnyvale sites indicates that you can decommission those sites. However, you can't decommission the Vancouver site because it contains the primary Admin Node.

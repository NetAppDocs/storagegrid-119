[.lead]
The recovery process for an Admin Node depends on whether it is the primary Admin Node or a non-primary Admin Node.

The high-level steps for recovering a primary or non-primary Admin Node are the same, although the details of the steps differ.

Always follow the correct recovery procedure for the Admin Node you are recovering. The procedures look the same at a high level, but differ in the details.

[.lead]
Before you power down a host, you must stop services on all grid nodes on that host.

.Steps

. Log in to the grid node:
 .. Enter the following command: `ssh admin@_grid_node_IP_`
 .. Enter the password listed in the `Passwords.txt` file.
 .. Enter the following command to switch to root: `su -`
 .. Enter the password listed in the `Passwords.txt` file.

+
When you are logged in as root, the prompt changes from `$` to `#`.
. Stop all services running on the node: `service servermanager stop`
+
Services can take up to 15 minutes to shut down, and you might want to log in to the system remotely to monitor the shutdown process.

. Repeat steps 1 and 2 for each node on the host.
. If you have a Linux host:
 .. Log in to the host operating system.
 .. Stop the node: `storagegrid node stop`
 .. Shut down the host operating system.
. If the node is running on a VMware virtual machine or it is an appliance node, issue the shutdown command: `shutdown -h now`
+
Perform this step regardless of the outcome of the `service servermanager stop` command.
+
NOTE: After you issue the `shutdown -h now` command on an appliance node, you must power cycle the appliance to restart the node.
+
For the appliance, this command shuts down the controller, but the appliance is still powered on. You must complete the next step.

. If you are powering down an appliance node, follow the steps for your appliance.

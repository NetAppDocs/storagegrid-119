If you need to remove more than one Storage Node, you can decommission them either sequentially or in parallel.

CAUTION: Use caution when you decommission Storage Nodes in a grid containing software-based metadata-only nodes. If you decommission all nodes configured to store _both_ objects and metadata, the ability to store objects is removed from the grid. See link:../primer/what-storage-node-is.html#types-of-storage-nodes[Types of Storage Nodes] for more information about metadata-only Storage Nodes.

* If you decommission Storage Nodes sequentially, you must wait for the first Storage Node to complete decommissioning before starting to decommission the next Storage Node.
* If you decommission Storage Nodes in parallel, the Storage Nodes simultaneously process decommission tasks for all Storage Nodes being decommissioned. This can result in a situation where all permanent copies of a file are marked as "read‚Äêonly," temporarily disabling deletion in grids where this functionality is enabled.

If you want to configure an endpoint for the Load Balancer service, and you want to use a port that has already been configured as the Mapped-To Port of a port remap, you must first remove the existing port remap, or the endpoint will not be effective. You must run a script on each Admin Node and Gateway Node that has conflicting remapped ports to remove all of the node's port remaps.

.About this task

This procedure removes all port remaps. If you need to keep some of the remaps, contact technical support.

For information about configuring load balancer endpoints, see link:../admin/configuring-load-balancer-endpoints.html[Configuring load balancer endpoints].

NOTE: If the port remap provides client access, reconfigure the client to use a different port as an load balancer endpoint to avoid loss of service. Otherwise, removing the port mapping will result in loss of client access and should be scheduled appropriately.

NOTE: This procedure does not work for a StorageGRID system deployed as a container on bare metal hosts. See the instructions for link:removing-port-remaps-on-bare-metal-hosts.html[removing port remaps on bare metal hosts].

.Steps

. Log in to the node.
 .. Enter the following command: `ssh -p 8022 admin@node_IP`
+
Port 8022 is the SSH port of the base OS, while port 22 is the SSH port of the container engine running StorageGRID.

 .. Enter the password listed in the `Passwords.txt` file.
 .. Enter the following command to switch to root: `su -`
 .. Enter the password listed in the `Passwords.txt` file.
+
When you are logged in as root, the prompt changes from `$` to `#`.

. Run the following script: `remove-port-remap.sh`
. Reboot the node: `reboot`
. Log out of the command shell: `exit`

. Repeat these steps on each Admin Node and Gateway Node that has conflicting remapped ports.

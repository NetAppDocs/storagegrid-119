+
The blue status bar indicates which task is currently in progress. Green status bars indicate tasks that have completed successfully.
+
NOTE: The installer ensures that tasks completed in a previous install aren't re-run. If you are re-running an installation, any tasks that don't need to be re-run are shown with a green status bar and a status of "Skipped."

. Review the progress of first two installation stages.
 ** *1. Configure storage*
+
During this stage, the installer connects to the storage controller, clears any existing configuration, communicates with SANtricity OS to configure volumes, and configures host settings.

 ** *2. Install OS*
+
During this stage, the installer copies the base operating system image for StorageGRID to the appliance.
. Continue monitoring the installation progress until the *Install StorageGRID* stage pauses and a message appears on the embedded console prompting you to approve this node on the Admin Node using the Grid Manager.

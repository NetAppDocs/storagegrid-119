After replacing a Storage Node, you must select Start Recovery in the Grid Manager to configure the new node as a replacement for the failed node.

.Before you begin

* You are signed in to the Grid Manager using a link:../admin/web-browser-requirements.html[supported web browser].
* You have the link:../admin/admin-group-permissions.html[Maintenance or Root access permission].
* You have the provisioning passphrase.
* You have deployed and configured the replacement node.
* You have the start date of any repair jobs for erasure-coded data.
* You have verified that the Storage Node has not been rebuilt within the last 15 days.

.About this task

If the Storage Node is installed as a container on a Linux host, you must perform this step only if one of these is true:

* You had to use the `--force` flag to import the node, or you issued `storagegrid node force-recovery _node-name_`
* You had to do a full node reinstall, or you needed to restore /var/local.

.Steps

. From the Grid Manager, select *MAINTENANCE* > *Tasks* > *Recovery*.
. Select the grid node you want to recover in the Pending Nodes list.
+
Nodes appear in the list after they fail, but you can't select a node until it has been reinstalled and is ready for recovery.

. Enter the *Provisioning Passphrase*.
. Click *Start Recovery*.

. Monitor the progress of the recovery in the Recovering Grid Node table.
+
NOTE: While the recovery procedure is running, you can click *Reset* to start a new recovery. A dialog box appears, indicating that the node will be left in an indeterminate state if you reset the procedure.

If you want to retry the recovery after resetting the procedure, you must restore the node to a pre-installed state, as follows:

 ** *VMware*: Delete the deployed virtual grid node. Then, when you are ready to restart the recovery, redeploy the node.
 ** *Linux*: Restart the node by running this command on the Linux host: `storagegrid node force-recovery _node-name_`

. When the Storage Node reaches the "Waiting for Manual Steps" stage, go to link:remounting-and-reformatting-storage-volumes-manual-steps.html[Remount and reformat storage volumes (manual steps)].

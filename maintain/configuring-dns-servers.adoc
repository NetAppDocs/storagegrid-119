[.lead]
You can add, update, and remove DNS servers, so that you can use fully qualified domain name (FQDN) hostnames rather than IP addresses.

To use fully qualified domain names (FQDNs) instead of IP addresses when specifying hostnames for external destinations, specify the IP address of each DNS server you will use. These entries are used for AutoSupport, alert emails, SNMP notifications, platform services endpoints, Cloud Storage Pools, and more.

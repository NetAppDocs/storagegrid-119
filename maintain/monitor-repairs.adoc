[.lead]
You can monitor the status of repair jobs by using the `repair-data` script from the command line.

These include jobs that you initiated manually, or jobs that StorageGRID initiated automatically as part of a decommission procedure.

NOTE: If you are running volume restoration jobs, link:../maintain/restoring-volume.html[monitor the progress and view a history of those jobs in the Grid Manager] instead.

Monitor the status of `repair-data` jobs based on whether you use *replicated data*, *erasure-coded (EC) data*, or both.

From Step 4 (Remove ILM References) of the Decommission Site wizard, you must delete or edit any unused ILM rules that refer to the site, even if the rules are not used in any ILM policy.

.Steps

. Determine whether any unused ILM rules refer to the site.
+
If any ILM rules are listed, those rules still refer to the site but aren't used in any policy.
+
NOTE: When StorageGRID decommissions the site, it will automatically deactivate any unused erasure-coding profiles that refer to the site, and it will automatically delete any unused storage pools that refer to the site. The All Storage Nodes storage pool (StorageGRID 11.6 and earlier) is removed because it uses the All Sites site.

. Edit or delete each unused rule:
** To edit a rule, go the ILM rules page and update all placements that use an erasure-coding profile or storage pool that refers to the site. Then, return to *Step 4 (Remove ILM References)*.

** To delete a rule, select the trash can icon image:../media/icon_trash_can.png[Icon Trash Can] and select *OK*.
+
NOTE: You must delete the *Make 2 Copies* rule before you can decommission a site.
. Confirm that no unused ILM rules refer to the site, and the *Next* button is enabled.

. Select *Next*.
+
NOTE: Any remaining storage pools and erasure-coding profiles that refer to the site will become invalid when the site is removed. When StorageGRID decommissions the site, it will automatically deactivate any unused erasure-coding profiles that refer to the site, and it will automatically delete any unused storage pools that refer to the site. The All Storage Nodes storage pool (StorageGRID 11.6 and earlier) is removed because it uses the All Sites site.

Step 5 (Resolve Node Conflicts) appears.

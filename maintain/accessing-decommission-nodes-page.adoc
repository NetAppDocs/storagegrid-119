When you access the Decommission Nodes page in the Grid Manager, you can see at a glance which nodes can be decommissioned.

.Before you begin

* You are signed in to the Grid Manager using a link:../admin/web-browser-requirements.html[supported web browser].
* You have the link:../admin/admin-group-permissions.html[Maintenance or Root access permission].

CAUTION: Use caution when you decommission Storage Nodes in a grid containing software-based metadata-only nodes. If you decommission all nodes configured to store _both_ objects and metadata, the ability to store objects is removed from the grid. See link:../primer/what-storage-node-is.html#types-of-storage-nodes[Types of Storage Nodes] for more information about metadata-only Storage Nodes.

.Steps

. Select *MAINTENANCE* > *Tasks* > *Decommission*.
. Select *Decommission Nodes*.
+
The Decommission Nodes page appears. From this page, you can:

 ** Determine which grid nodes can be decommissioned currently.
 ** See the health of all grid nodes
 ** Sort the list in ascending or descending order by *Name*, *Site*, *Type*, or *Has ADC*.
 ** Enter search terms to quickly find particular nodes.
+
In this example, the Decommission Possible column indicates that you can decommission the Gateway Node and one of the four Storage Nodes.

. Review the *Decommission Possible* column for each node you want to decommission.
+
If a grid node can be decommissioned, this column includes a green check mark, and the left column includes a checkbox. If a node can't be decommissioned, this column describes the issue. If there is more than one reason a node can't be decommissioned, the most critical reason is shown.

| Decommission Possible reason
| Description
| Steps to resolve

| No, _node type_ decommissioning is not supported.
| You can't decommission the primary Admin Node.
| None.

| No, at least one grid node is disconnected.

*Note:* This message is shown for connected grid nodes only.
| You can't decommission a connected grid node if any grid node is disconnected.

The *Health* column includes one of these icons for grid nodes that are disconnected:

 ** image:../media/icon_alarm_gray_administratively_down.png[gray questionmark icon] (gray): Administratively Down
 ** image:../media/icon_alarm_blue_unknown.png[blue question mark icon] (blue): Unknown

| You must bring all disconnected nodes back online or link:decommissioning-disconnected-grid-nodes.html[decommission all disconnected nodes] before you can remove a connected node.

*Note*: If your grid contains multiple disconnected nodes, the software requires you to decommission them all at the same time, which increases the potential for unexpected results.

| No, one or more required nodes is currently disconnected and must be recovered.

*Note:* This message is shown for disconnected grid nodes only.
| You can't decommission a disconnected grid node if one or more required nodes is also disconnected (for example, a Storage Node that is required for the ADC quorum).
|
.. Review the Decommission Possible messages for all disconnected nodes.
.. Determine which nodes can't be decommissioned because they are required.
  *** If the Health of a required node is Administratively Down, bring the node back online.
  *** If the health of a required node is Unknown, perform a node recovery procedure to recover the required node.

| No, member of HA group(s): _group name_. Before you can decommission this node, you must remove it from all HA groups.
| You can't decommission an Admin Node or a Gateway Node if a node interface belongs to a high availability (HA) group.
| Edit the HA group to remove the node's interface or remove the entire HA group. See link:../admin/configure-high-availability-group.html[Configure high availability groups].

| No, site _x_ requires a minimum of _n_ Storage Nodes with ADC services.
| *Storage Nodes only.* You can't decommission a Storage Node if insufficient nodes would remain at the site to support ADC quorum requirements.
| Perform an expansion. Add a new Storage Node to the site, and specify that it should have an ADC service. See information about the link:understanding-adc-service-quorum.html[ADC quorum].

| No, one or more erasure-coding profiles need at least _n_ Storage Nodes. If the profile is not used in an ILM rule, you can deactivate it.
| *Storage Nodes only.* You can't decommission a Storage Node unless enough nodes would remain for the existing erasure-coding profiles.

For example, if an erasure-coding profile exists for 4+2 erasure coding, at least 6 Storage Nodes must remain.

| For each affected erasure-coding profile, perform one of the following steps, based on how the profile is being used:

 * *Used in active ILM policies*: Perform an expansion. Add enough new Storage Nodes to allow erasure coding to continue. See the instructions for link:../expand/index.html[expanding your grid].
 * *Used in an ILM rule but not in active ILM policies*: Edit or delete the rule and then deactivate the erasure-coding profile.
 * *Not used in any ILM rule*: Deactivate the erasure-coding profile.

*Note:* An error message appears if you attempt to deactivate an erasure-coding profile and object data is still associated with the profile. You might need to wait several weeks before trying the deactivation process again.

Learn about link:../ilm/manage-erasure-coding-profiles.html[deactivating an erasure-coding profile].

| No, you can't decommission an Archive Node unless the node is disconnected.
| If an Archive Node is still connected, you can't remove it.
| *Note*: Support for Archive Nodes has been removed. If you need to decommission an Archive Node, see https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/storagegrid-118/maintain/grid-node-decommissioning.html[Grid node decommissioning (StorageGRID 11.8 doc site)^]

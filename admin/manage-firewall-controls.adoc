StorageGRID includes an internal firewall on each node that enhances the security of your grid by enabling you to control network access to the node. Use the firewall to prevent network access on all ports except those necessary for your specific grid deployment. The configuration changes you make on the Firewall control page are deployed to each node.

Use the three tabs on the Firewall control page to customize the access you need for your grid. 

* *Privileged address list*: Use this tab to allow selected access to closed ports. You can add IP addresses or subnets in CIDR notation that can access ports closed using the Manage external access tab.
* *Manage external access*: Use this tab to close ports that are open by default, or reopen ports previously closed.
* *Untrusted Client Network*: Use this tab to specify whether a node trusts inbound traffic from the Client Network.
+
The settings on this tab override the settings in the Manage external access tab. 

**	A node with an untrusted Client Network will accept only connections on load balancer endpoint ports configured on that node (global, node interface and node type bound endpoints).
** Load balancer endpoint ports _are the only open ports_ on untrusted Client Networks, regardless of the settings on the Manage external networks tab.
** When trusted, all ports opened under the Manage external access tab are accessible, as well as any load balancer endpoints opened on the Client Network.

NOTE: The settings you make on one tab can affect the access changes you make on another tab. Be sure to check the settings on all tabs to ensure your network behaves in the way you expect. 

To configure internal firewall controls, see link:../admin/configure-firewall-controls.html[Configure firewall controls].

For more information about external firewalls and network security, see link:../admin/controlling-access-through-firewalls.html[Control access at external firewall].

== Privileged address list and Manage external access tabs
The Privileged address list tab enables you to register one or more IP addresses that are granted access to grid ports that are closed. The Manage external access tab enables you to close external access to selected external ports or all open external ports (external ports are ports that are accessible by non-grid nodes by default). These two tabs often can be used together to customize the exact network access you need to allow for your grid.

NOTE: Privileged IP addresses don't have internal grid port access by default. 

=== Example 1: Use a jump host for maintenance tasks

Suppose you want to use a jump host (a security hardened host) for network administration. You could use these general steps:

. Use the Privileged address list tab to add the IP address of the jump host. 
. Use the Manage external access tab to block all ports.

CAUTION: Add the privileged IP address before you block ports 443 and 8443. Any users currently connected on a blocked port, including you, will lose access to Grid Manager unless their IP address has been added to the Privileged address list. 

After you save your configuration, all external ports on the Admin Node in your grid will be blocked for all hosts except the jump host. You can then use the jump host to perform maintenance tasks on your grid more securely.

=== Example 2: Lock down sensitive ports
Suppose you want to lock down sensitive ports and the service on that port (for example, SSH on port 22). You could use the following general steps: 

. Use the Privileged address list tab to grant access only to the hosts that need access to the service.
. Use the Manage external access tab to block all ports. 

CAUTION: Add the privileged IP address before you block access to any ports assigned to access Grid Manager and Tenant manager (preset ports are 443 and 8443). Any users currently connected on a blocked port, including you, will lose access to Grid Manager unless their IP address has been added to the Privileged address list. 

After you save your configuration, port 22 and SSH service will be available to hosts on the privileged address list. All other hosts will be denied access to the service no matter what interface the request comes from.

=== Example 3: Disable access to unused services
At a network level, you could disable some services that you don't intend to use. For example, to block HTTP S3 client traffic, you would use the toggle on the Manage external access tab to block port 18084. 

== Untrusted Client Networks tab

If you are using a Client Network, you can help secure StorageGRID from hostile attacks by accepting inbound client traffic only on explicitly configured endpoints. 

By default, the Client Network on each grid node is _trusted_. That is, by default, StorageGRID trusts inbound connections to each grid node on all link:../network/external-communications.html[available external ports].

You can reduce the threat of hostile attacks on your StorageGRID system by specifying that the Client Network on each node be _untrusted_. If a node's Client Network is untrusted, the node only accepts inbound connections on ports explicitly configured as load balancer endpoints. See link:../admin/configuring-load-balancer-endpoints.html[Configure load balancer endpoints] and link:../admin/configure-firewall-controls.html[Configure firewall controls].

=== Example 1: Gateway Node only accepts HTTPS S3 requests

Suppose you want a Gateway Node to refuse all inbound traffic on the Client Network except for HTTPS S3 requests. You would perform these general steps:

. From the link:../admin/configuring-load-balancer-endpoints.html[Load balancer endpoints] page, configure a load balancer endpoint for S3 over HTTPS on port 443.
. From the Firewall control page, select Untrusted to specify that the Client Network on the Gateway Node is untrusted.

After you save your configuration, all inbound traffic on the Gateway Node's Client Network is dropped except for HTTPS S3 requests on port 443 and ICMP echo (ping) requests.

=== Example 2: Storage Node sends S3 platform services requests

Suppose you want to enable outbound S3 platform services traffic from a Storage Node, but you want to prevent any inbound connections to that Storage Node on the Client Network. You would perform this general step:

* From the Untrusted Client Networks tab of the Firewall control page, indicate that the Client Network on the Storage Node is untrusted.

After you save your configuration, the Storage Node no longer accepts any incoming traffic on the Client Network, but it continues to allow outbound requests to configured platform services destinations.

=== Example 3: Limiting access to Grid Manager to a subnet

Suppose you want to allow Grid Manager access only on a specific subnet. You would perform the following steps: 

. Attach the Client Network of your Admin Nodes to the subnet.
. Use the Untrusted Client Network tab to configure the Client Network as untrusted.
. When you create a management interface load balancer endpoint, enter port and select the management interface that the port will access.
. Select *Yes* for Untrusted Client Network.
. Use the Manage external access tab to block all external ports (with or without privileged IP addresses set for hosts outside that subnet).

After you save your configuration, only hosts on the subnet you specified can access the Grid Manager. All other hosts are are blocked.

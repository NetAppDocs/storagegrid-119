= Sign in to the Grid Manager
:icons: font

[.lead]
You access the Grid Manager sign-in page by entering the fully qualified domain name (FQDN) or IP address of an Admin Node into the address bar of a supported web browser.

Each StorageGRID system includes one primary Admin Node and any number of non-primary Admin Nodes. You can sign in to the Grid Manager on any Admin Node to manage the StorageGRID system. However, some maintenance procedures can only be performed from the primary Admin Node.

=== Connect to HA group

If Admin Nodes are included in a high availability (HA) group, you connect using the virtual IP address of the HA group or a fully qualified domain name that maps to the virtual IP address. The primary Admin Node should be selected as the group's primary interface, so that when you access the Grid Manager, you access it on the primary Admin Node unless the primary Admin Node is not available. See  link:managing-high-availability-groups.html[Manage high availability groups].

=== Use SSO

The sign-in steps are slightly different if link:configuring-sso.html[single sign-on (SSO) has been configured].


== Sign in to Grid Manager on first Admin Node

.Before you begin
* You have your login credentials.
* You are using a link:../admin/web-browser-requirements.html[supported web browser].
* Cookies are enabled in your web browser.
* You belong to a user group that has at least one permission.
* You have the URL for the Grid Manager:
+
`https://_FQDN_or_Admin_Node_IP_/`
+
You can use the fully qualified domain name, the IP address of an Admin Node,  or the virtual IP address of an HA group of Admin Nodes.
+
To access the Grid Manager on a port other than the default port for HTTPS (443), include the port number in the URL:
+
`https://_FQDN_or_Admin_Node_IP:port_/`
+
NOTE: SSO is not available on the restricted Grid Manager port. You must use port 443.


.Steps
. Launch a supported web browser.
. In the browser's address bar, enter the URL for the Grid Manager.

. If you are prompted with a security alert, install the certificate using the browser's installation wizard. See link:using-storagegrid-security-certificates.html[Manage security certificates].

. Sign in to the Grid Manager.
+
The sign-in screen that appears depends on whether single sign-on (SSO) has been configured for StorageGRID.

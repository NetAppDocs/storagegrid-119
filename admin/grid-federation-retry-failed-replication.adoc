After resolving the *Cross-grid replication permanent failure* alert, you should determine if any objects or delete markers failed to be replicated to the other grid. You can then reingest these objects or use the Grid Management API to retry replication.

The *Cross-grid replication permanent failure* alert indicates that tenant objects can't be replicated between the buckets on two grids for a reason that requires user intervention to resolve. This alert is typically caused by a change to either the source or the destination bucket. For details, see link:grid-federation-troubleshoot.html[Troubleshoot grid federation errors].

== Determine if any objects failed to be replicated

To determine if any objects or delete markers have not been replicated to the other grid, you can search the audit log for link:../audit/cgrr-cross-grid-replication-request.html[CGRR (Cross-Grid Replication Request)] messages. This message is added to the log when StorageGRID fails to replicate an object, multipart object, or delete marker to the destination bucket.

You can use the link:../audit/using-audit-explain-tool.html[audit-explain tool] to translate the results into an easier-to-read format.

.Before you begin

* You have Root access permission.
* You have the `Passwords.txt` file.
* You know the IP address of the primary Admin Node.

.Steps

. Log in to the primary Admin Node:

.. Enter the following command: `ssh admin@_primary_Admin_Node_IP_`
.. Enter the password listed in the `Passwords.txt` file.
.. Enter the following command to switch to root: `su -`
.. Enter the password listed in the `Passwords.txt` file.
+
When you are logged in as root, the prompt changes from `$` to `#`.
. Search the audit.log for CGRR messages, and use the audit-explain tool to format the results.
+
For example, this command greps for all CGRR messages in the past 30 minutes and uses the audit-explain tool.
+
`# awk -vdate=$(date -d "30 minutes ago" '+%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%S') '$1$2 >= date { print }' audit.log | grep CGRR | audit-explain`
+
The results of the command will look like this example, which has entries for six CGRR messages. In the example, all cross-grid replication requests returned a general error because the object could not be replicated. The first three errors are for "replicate object" operations, and the last three errors are for "replicate delete marker" operations.

Each entry contains the following information:
+
[cols="1a,2a" options=header] 
|===

| Field | Description

m| CGRR Cross-Grid Replication Request
| The name of the request

m| tenant
| The tenant's account ID

m| connection
| The ID of the grid federation connection

m| operation
| The type of replication operation that was being attempted:

* replicate object
* replicate delete marker
* replicate multipart object

m| bucket
| The bucket name

m| object
| The object name

m| version
| The version ID for the object

m| error
| The type of error. If cross-grid replication failed, the error is "General error".

== Retry failed replications

After generating a list of objects and delete markers that were not replicated to the destination bucket and resolving the underlying issues, you can retry replication in either of two ways:

* Reingest each object into the source bucket.

* Use the Grid Management private API, as described.

.Steps

. From the top of the Grid Manager, select the help icon and select *API documentation*.

. Select *Go to private API documentation*.
+
NOTE: The StorageGRID API endpoints that are marked "Private" are subject to change without notice. StorageGRID private endpoints also ignore the API version of the request.

. In the *cross-grid-replication-advanced* section, select the following endpoint:
+
`POST /private/cross-grid-replication-retry-failed`

. Select *Try it out*.

. In the *body* text box, replace the example entry for *versionID* with a version ID from the audit.log that corresponds to a failed cross-grid-replication request.
+
Be sure to retain the double quotes around the string.

. Select *Execute*.

. Confirm that the server response code is *204*, indicating that the object or delete marker has been marked as pending for cross-grid replication to the other grid. 
+
NOTE: Pending means the cross-grid replication request has been added to the internal queue for processing. 

== Monitor replication retries

You should monitor the replication retry operations to make sure they complete.

TIP: It might take several hours or longer for an object or delete marker to be replicated to the other grid.

You can monitor retry operations in either of two ways:

* Use an S3 link:../s3/head-object.html[HeadObject] or link:../s3/get-object.html[GetObject] request. The response includes the StorageGRID-specific `x-ntap-sg-cgr-replication-status` response header, which will have one of the following values:
+
[cols="1a,2a" options="header"]

|===

| Grid| Replication status 

| Source
| * *COMPLETED*: The replication was successful.
* *PENDING*: The object hasn't been replicated yet.
* *FAILURE*: The replication failed with a permanent failure. A user must resolve the error.

| Destination
| *REPLICA*: The object was replicated from the source grid.

|=== 

* Use the Grid Management private API, as described.

.Steps

. In the *cross-grid-replication-advanced* section of the private API documentation, select the following endpoint:
+
`GET /private/cross-grid-replication-object-status/{id}`

. Select *Try it out*.

. In the Parameter section, enter the version ID you used in the `cross-grid-replication-retry-failed` request. 

. Select *Execute*.

. Confirm that the server response code is *200*. 

. Review the replication status, which will be one of the following:

* *PENDING*: The object hasn't been replicated yet.
* *COMPLETED*: The replication was successful.
* *FAILED*: The replication failed with a permanent failure. A user must resolve the error.

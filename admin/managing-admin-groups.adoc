[.lead]
You can create admin groups to manage the security permissions for one or more admin users. Users must belong to a group to be granted access to the StorageGRID system.

.Before you begin

* You are signed in to the Grid Manager using a link:../admin/web-browser-requirements.html[supported web browser].

* You have link:admin-group-permissions.html[specific access permissions].

* If you plan to import a federated group, you have configured identity federation and the federated group already exists in the configured identity source.

== Create an admin group

Admin groups allow you to determine which users can access which features and operations in the Grid Manager and the Grid Management API.

=== Access the wizard

.Steps

. Select *CONFIGURATION* > *Access control* > *Admin groups*.

. Select *Create group*.

=== Choose a group type

You can create a local group or import a federated group.

** Create a local group if you want to assign permissions to local users.
** Create a federated group to import users from the identity source.

.Local group
--


.Steps
. Select *Local group*.
. Enter a display name for the group, which you can update later as required. For example, "Maintenance Users" or "ILM Administrators."
. Enter a unique name for the group, which you can't update later. 

. Select *Continue*. 
--
//end local, begin federated

.Federated group
--

.Steps
. Select *Federated group*.
. Enter the name of the group you want to import, exactly as it appears in the configured identity source. 

** For Active Directory and Azure, use the sAMAccountName.
** For OpenLDAP, use the CN (Common Name).
** For another LDAP, use the appropriate unique name for the LDAP server.

. Select *Continue*.

====
//end tabbed blocks


=== Manage group permissions

.Steps

. For *Access mode*, select whether users in the group can change settings and perform operations in the Grid Manager and the Grid Management API or whether they can only view settings and features.
 ** *Read-write* (default): Users can change settings and perform the operations allowed by their management permissions.
 ** *Read-only*: Users can only view settings and features. They can't make any changes or perform any operations in the Grid Manager or Grid Management API. Local read-only users can change their own passwords.
+
NOTE: If a user belongs to multiple groups and any group is set to *Read-only*, the user will have read-only access to all selected settings and features.

. Select one or more link:admin-group-permissions.html[admin group permissions].
+
You must assign at least one permission to each group; otherwise, users belonging to the group will not be able to sign in to StorageGRID.

. If you are creating a local group, select *Continue*. If you are creating a federated group, select *Create group* and *Finish*.

=== Add users (local groups only)
.Steps

. Optionally, select one or more local users for this group.
+
If you have not yet created local users, you can save the group without adding users. You can add this group to the user on the Users page. See 
link:managing-users.html[Manage users] for details.

. Select *Create group* and *Finish*.

== View and edit admin groups

You can view details for existing groups, modify a group, or duplicate a group.

* To view basic information for all groups, review the table on the Groups page. 

* To view all details for a specific group or to edit a group, use the *Actions* menu or the details page.

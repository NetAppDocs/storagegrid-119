Load balancer endpoints determine the ports and network protocols S3 clients can use when connecting to the StorageGRID load balancer on Gateway and Admin Nodes. You can also use endpoints to access the Grid Manager, Tenant Manager, or both.

TIP: Swift details have been removed from this version of the doc site. See https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/storagegrid-118/admin/configuring-client-connections.html[Configure S3 and Swift client connections^].

.Before you begin

* You are signed in to the Grid Manager using a link:../admin/web-browser-requirements.html[supported web browser].

* You have the link:admin-group-permissions.html[Root access permission].

* You have reviewed the link:managing-load-balancing.html[considerations for load balancing].

* If you previously remapped a port you intend to use for the load balancer endpoint, you have link:../maintain/removing-port-remaps.html[removed the port remap].

* You have created any high availability (HA) groups you plan to use. HA groups are recommended, but not required. See link:managing-high-availability-groups.html[Manage high availability groups].

* If the load balancer endpoint will be used by link:../admin/manage-s3-select-for-tenant-accounts.html[S3 tenants for S3 Select], it must not use the IP addresses or FQDNs of any bare-metal nodes. Only services appliances and VMware-based software nodes are allowed for the load balancer endpoints used for S3 Select.

*  You have configured any VLAN interfaces you plan to use. See link:configure-vlan-interfaces.html[Configure VLAN interfaces].

* If you are creating an HTTPS endpoint (recommended), you have the information for the server certificate.
+
NOTE: Changes to an endpoint certificate can take up to 15 minutes to be applied to all nodes.

** To upload a certificate, you need the server certificate, the certificate private key, and optionally, a CA bundle.

** To generate a certificate, you need all of the domain names and IP addresses that S3 clients will use to access the endpoint. You must also know the subject (Distinguished Name).

** If you want to use the StorageGRID S3 API certificate (which can also be used for connections directly to Storage Nodes), you have already replaced the default certificate with a custom certificate signed by an external certificate authority. See 
link:../admin/configuring-custom-server-certificate-for-storage-node.html[Configure S3 API certificates].

[[create-lb-endpoint]]
== Create a load balancer endpoint

Each S3 client load balancer endpoint specifies a port, a client type (S3), and a network protocol (HTTP or HTTPS). Management interface load balancer endpoints specifies a port, interface type, and untrusted Client Network.

=== Access the wizard

.Steps

. Select *CONFIGURATION* > *Network* > *Load balancer endpoints*.
. To create an endpoint for an S3 or Swift client, select the *S3 or Swift client* tab.
. To create an endpoint for access to the Grid Manager, Tenant Manager, or both, select the *Management interface* tab.
. Select *Create*.

[[enter-endpoint-details]]
=== Enter endpoint details

.Steps

. Select the appropriate instructions to enter details for the type of endpoint you want to create.

// start tabbed area

[role="tabbed-block"]
====

.S3 or Swift client
--
[cols="1a,3a" options="header"]
|===
| Field| Description

| Name
| A descriptive name for the endpoint, which will appear in the table on the Load balancer endpoints page.

| Port
| The StorageGRID port you want to use for load balancing. This field defaults to 10433 for the first endpoint you create, but you can enter any unused external port from 1 to 65535.

If you enter *80* or *8443*, the endpoint is configured only on Gateway Nodes, unless you have freed up port 8443. Then you can use port 8443 as an S3 endpoint, and the port will be configured on both Gateway and Admin Nodes.

| Client type
| The type of client application that will use this endpoint, either *S3* or *Swift*.

| Network protocol
| The network protocol that clients will use when connecting to this endpoint.

*  Select *HTTPS* for secure, TLS encrypted communication (recommended). You must attach a security certificate before you can save the endpoint.

* Select *HTTP* for less secure, unencrypted communication. Use HTTP only for a non-production grid.
|===

.Management interface
--
[cols="1a,3a" options="header"]
|===
| Field| Description

| Name
| A descriptive name for the endpoint, which will appear in the table on the Load balancer endpoints page.

| Port
| The StorageGRID port you want to use to access the Grid Manager, Tenant Manager, or both.

* Grid Manager: *8443*
* Tenant Manager: *9443*
* Both Grid Manager and Tenant Manager: *443*

*Note*:  You can use these preset ports or other available ports.

| Interface type
| Select the radio button for the StorageGRID interface you will access using this endpoint.

| Untrusted Client Network
| Select *Yes* if this endpoint should be accessible to untrusted Client Networks. Otherwise, select *No*.

When you select *Yes*, the port is open on all untrusted Client Networks.

*Note*: You can only configure a port to be open or closed to untrusted Client Networks when you are creating the load balancer endpoint.

// end tabbed area

[start=2]
. Select *Continue*.

=== Select a binding mode

.Steps

. Select a binding mode for the endpoint to control how the endpoint is accessed using any IP address or using specific IP addresses and network interfaces.
+
Some binding modes are available for either client endpoints or management interface endpoints. All modes for both endpoint types are listed here.
+
//Some rows of this table are unique for this topic. Be sure to update the common rows for this table and for the (include) for fp or s3 setup wizards table
+
[cols="1a,3a" options="header"]
|===
| Mode | Description

| Global (default for client endpoints)
| Clients can access the endpoint using the IP address of any Gateway Node or Admin Node, the virtual IP (VIP) address of any HA group on any network, or a corresponding FQDN.

Use the *Global* setting unless you need to restrict the accessibility of this endpoint.

| Virtual IPs of HA groups
| Clients must use a virtual IP address (or corresponding FQDN) of an HA group to access this endpoint.

Endpoints with this binding mode can all use the same port number, as long as the HA groups you select for the endpoints don't overlap.

| Node interfaces
| Clients must use the IP addresses (or corresponding FQDNs) of selected node interfaces to access this endpoint.

| Node type (client endpoints only)
| Based on the type of node you select, clients must use either the IP address (or corresponding FQDN) of any Admin Node or the IP address (or corresponding FQDN) of any Gateway Node to access this endpoint.

| All Admin Nodes (default for management interface endpoints)
| Clients must use the IP address (or corresponding FQDN) of any Admin Node to access this endpoint.
|===
+

If more than one endpoint uses the same port, StorageGRID uses this priority order to decide which endpoint to use: *Virtual IPs of HA groups* > *Node interfaces* > *Node type* > *Global*. 
+
If you are creating management interface endpoints, only Admin Nodes are allowed.

. If you selected *Virtual IPs of HA groups*, select one or more HA groups.
+
If you are creating management interface endpoints, select VIPs associated only with Admin Nodes.

. If you selected *Node interfaces*, select one or more node interfaces for each Admin Node or Gateway Node that you want to associate with this endpoint.

. If you selected *Node type*, select either Admin Nodes, which includes both the primary Admin Node and any non-primary Admin Nodes, or Gateway Nodes.

=== Control tenant access

NOTE: A management interface endpoint can control tenant access only when the endpoint has the <<enter-endpoint-details,interface type of Tenant Manager>>.

.Steps

. For the *Tenant access* step, select one of the following:
+
[cols="1a,2a" options="header"]
|===
|Field| Description

| Allow all tenants (default)
| All tenant accounts can use this endpoint to access their buckets. 

You must select this option if you have not yet created any tenant accounts. After you add tenant accounts, you can edit the load balancer endpoint to allow or block specific accounts. 

| Allow selected tenants
| Only the selected tenant accounts can use this endpoint to access their buckets.

| Block selected tenants
| The selected tenant accounts can't use this endpoint to access their buckets. All other tenants can use this endpoint.
|===

. If you are creating an *HTTP* endpoint, you don't need to attach a certificate. Select *Create* to add the new load balancer endpoint. Then, go to <<after-you-finish,After you finish>>. Otherwise, select *Continue* to attach the certificate.

=== Attach certificate

.Steps

. If you are creating an *HTTPS* endpoint, select the type of security certificate you want to attach to the endpoint.
+
The certificate secures the connections between S3 clients and the Load Balancer service on Admin Node or Gateway Nodes.
+
* *Upload certificate*. Select this option if you have custom certificates to upload.

* *Generate certificate*. Select this option if you have the values needed to generate a custom certificate.

* *Use StorageGRID S3 certificate*. Select this option if you want to use the global S3 API certificate, which can also be used for connections directly to Storage Nodes. 
+
You can't select this option unless you have replaced the default S3 API certificate, which is signed by the grid CA, with a custom certificate signed by an external certificate authority. See
link:../admin/configuring-custom-server-certificate-for-storage-node.html[Configure S3 API certificates].

* *Use management interface certificate*. Select this option if you want to use the global management interface certificate, which can also be used for direct connections to Admin Nodes.

. If you aren't using the StorageGRID S3 certificate, upload or generate the certificate.

| One or more fully qualified domain names to include in the certificate. Use an * as a wildcard to represent multiple domain names.

| IP
| One or more IP addresses to include in the certificate.

|Subject (optional)
| X.509 subject or distinguished name (DN) of the certificate owner.

If no value is entered in this field, the generated certificate uses the first domain name or IP address as the subject common name (CN).

| Days valid
| Number of days after creation that the certificate expires.

| Add key usage extensions
| If selected (default and recommended), key usage and extended key usage extensions are added to the generated certificate. 

These extensions define the purpose of the key contained in the certificate.

//end tabbed blocks

=== After you finish

.Steps

. If you use a DNS, ensure that the DNS includes a record to associate the StorageGRID fully qualified domain name (FQDN) to each IP address that clients will use to make connections.
+
The IP address you enter in the DNS record depends on whether you are using an HA group of load-balancing nodes:

** If you have configured an HA group, clients will connect to the virtual IP addresses of that HA group.

** If you aren't using an HA group, clients will connect to the StorageGRID Load Balancer service using the IP address of a Gateway Node or Admin Node.
+
You must also ensure that the DNS record references all required endpoint domain names, including any wildcard names.

. Provide S3 clients with the information needed to connect to the endpoint:

** Port number
** Fully qualified domain name or IP address
** Any required certificate details

== View and edit load balancer endpoints

You can view details for existing load balancer endpoints, including the certificate metadata for a secured endpoint. You can change certain settings for an endpoint.

* To view basic information for all load balancer endpoints, review the tables on the Load balancer endpoints page. 

* To view all details about a specific endpoint, including certificate metadata, select the endpoint's name in the table. The information shown varies depending on the endpoint type and how it's configured.

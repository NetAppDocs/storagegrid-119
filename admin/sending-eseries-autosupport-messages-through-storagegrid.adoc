[.lead]
You can send E-Series SANtricity System Manager AutoSupport packages to technical support through a StorageGRID Admin Node rather than the storage appliance management port.

See https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/e-series-santricity/sm-support/autosupport-feature-overview.html[E-Series hardware AutoSupport^] for more information about using AutoSupport with E-Series appliances.

.Before you begin
* You are signed into the Grid Manager using a link:../admin/web-browser-requirements.html[supported web browser].
* You have the link:admin-group-permissions.html[Storage appliance administrator or Root access permission].
* You have configured SANtricity AutoSupport:
** For SG6000 and SG5700 appliances, https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/storagegrid-appliances/installconfig/accessing-and-configuring-santricity-system-manager.html[configure AutoSupport in SANtricity System Manager^]

NOTE: You must have SANtricity firmware 8.70 or higher to access SANtricity System Manager using the Grid Manager.

.About this task

E-Series AutoSupport packages contain details of the storage hardware and are more specific than other AutoSupport packages sent by the StorageGRID system.

You can configure a special proxy server address in SANtricity System Manager to transmit AutoSupport packages through a StorageGRID Admin Node without the use of the appliance's management port. AutoSupport packages transmitted in this way are sent by the link:../primer/what-admin-node-is.html[preferred sender Admin Node], and they use any link:../admin/configuring-admin-proxy-settings.html[admin proxy settings] that have been configured in the Grid Manager.

NOTE: This procedure is only for configuring a StorageGRID proxy server for E-Series AutoSupport packages. For additional details on E-Series AutoSupport configuration, see the https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/e-series-family/index.html[NetApp E-Series and SANtricity Documentation^].

.Steps
. In the Grid Manager, select *NODES*.
. From the list of nodes on the left, select the storage appliance node you want to configure.

. Select *HTTPS* for the delivery method.
+
NOTE: The certificate that enables HTTPS is pre-installed.

. Select *via Proxy server*.
. Enter `tunnel-host` for the *Host address*.
+
`tunnel-host` is the special address to use an Admin Node to send E-Series AutoSupport packages.

. Enter `10225` for the *Port number*.
+
`10225` is the port number on the StorageGRID proxy server that receives AutoSupport packages from the E-Series controller in the appliance.

. Select *Test Configuration* to test the routing and configuration of your AutoSupport proxy server.
+
If correct, a message in a green banner appears: "Your AutoSupport configuration has been verified."
+
If the test fails, an error message appears in a red banner. Check your StorageGRID DNS settings and networking, ensure the link:../primer/what-admin-node-is.html[preferred sender Admin Node] can connect to the NetApp Support Site, and try the test again.

. Select *Save*.
+
The configuration is saved, and a confirmation message appears: "AutoSupport delivery method has been configured."

[.lead]
You can use high availability (HA) groups to provide highly available connections to StorageGRID for object data and for administrative use.

* An HA group can provide highly available administrative connections to the Grid Manager or the Tenant Manager.
* An HA group can provide highly available data connections for S3 clients.
* An HA group that contains only one interface allows you to provide many VIP addresses and to explicitly set IPv6 addresses.

An HA group can provide high availability only if all nodes included in the group provide the same services. When you create an HA group, add interfaces from the types of nodes that provide the services you require.

* *Admin Nodes*: Include the Load Balancer service and enable access to the Grid Manager or the Tenant Manager.
* *Gateway Nodes*: Include the Load Balancer service.

== Limitations of using HA groups with Grid Manager or Tenant Manager

If a Grid Manager or Tenant Manager service fails, HA group failover is not triggered.

If you are signed in to the Grid Manager or the Tenant Manager when failover occurs, you are signed out and must sign in again to resume your task.

Some maintenance procedures can't be performed when the primary Admin Node is unavailable. During failover, you can use the Grid Manager to monitor your StorageGRID system.

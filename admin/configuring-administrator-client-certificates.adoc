[.lead]
Client certificates allow authorized external clients to access the StorageGRID Prometheus database, providing a secure way for external tools to monitor StorageGRID.

If you need to access StorageGRID using an external monitoring tool, you must upload or generate a client certificate using the Grid Manager and copy the certificate information to the external tool.

See link:using-storagegrid-security-certificates.html[Manage security certificates] and link:configuring-custom-server-certificate-for-grid-manager-tenant-manager.html[Configure custom server certificates]. 

NOTE: To ensure that operations aren't disrupted by a failed server certificate, the *Expiration of client certificates configured on the Certificates page* alert is triggered when this server certificate is about to expire. As required, you can view when the current certificate expires by selecting *CONFIGURATION* > *Security* > *Certificates* and looking at the Expiration date for the client certificate on the Client tab.

NOTE: If you are using a key management server (KMS) to protect the data on specially configured appliance nodes, see the specific information about link:kms-adding.html[uploading a KMS client certificate].

.Before you begin

* You have Root access permission.
* You are signed in to the Grid Manager using a link:../admin/web-browser-requirements.html[supported web browser].
* To configure a client certificate:
** You have the IP address or domain name of the Admin Node.
** If you have configured the StorageGRID management interface certificate, you have the CA, client certificate, and private key used to configure the management interface certificate.
** To upload your own certificate, the private key for the certificate is available on your local computer.
** The private key must have been saved or recorded at the time it was created. If you don't have the original private key, you must create a new one.
* To edit a client certificate:
** You have the IP address or domain name of the Admin Node.
** To upload your own certificate or a new certificate, the private key, client certificate, and CA (if used) are available on your local computer.

== Add client certificates

To add the client certificate, use one of these procedures:

* <<Management interface certificate already configured>>
* <<CA issued client certificate>>
* <<Generated certificate from Grid Manager>>


=== Management interface certificate already configured

Use this procedure to add a client certificate if a management interface certificate is already configured using a customer-supplied CA, client certificate, and private key. 

.Steps

. In the Grid Manager, select *CONFIGURATION* > *Security* > *Certificates* and then select the *Client* tab.
. Select *Add*.
. Enter a certificate name.
. To access Prometheus metrics using your external monitoring tool, select *Allow prometheus*.
. Select *Continue*.

. For the *Attach certificates* step, upload the management interface certificate.

.. Select *Upload certificate*.
.. Select *Browse* and select the management interface certificate file (`.pem`).
+
* Select *Client certificate details* to display the certificate metadata and certificate PEM.
* Select *Copy certificate PEM* to copy the certificate contents for pasting elsewhere.

.. Select *Create* to save the certificate in the Grid Manager.
+
The new certificate appears on the Client tab.

. <<configure-external-monitoring-tool,Configure an external monitoring tool>>, such as Grafana. 


=== CA issued client certificate

Use this procedure to add an administrator client certificate if a management interface certificate was not configured and you plan to add a client certificate for Prometheus that uses a CA issued client certificate and private key.

.Steps

. Perform the steps to link:configuring-custom-server-certificate-for-grid-manager-tenant-manager.html[configure a management interface certificate].
. In the Grid Manager, select *CONFIGURATION* > *Security* > *Certificates* and then select the *Client* tab.
. Select *Add*.
. Enter a certificate name.
. To access Prometheus metrics using your external monitoring tool, select *Allow prometheus*.
. Select *Continue*.

. For the *Attach certificates* step, upload the client certificate, private key, and CA bundle files:

.. Select *Upload certificate*.
.. Select *Browse* and select the client certificate, private key, and CA bundle files (`.pem`).
+
* Select *Client certificate details* to display the certificate metadata and certificate PEM.
* Select *Copy certificate PEM* to copy the certificate contents for pasting elsewhere.

.. Select *Create* to save the certificate in the Grid Manager.
+
The new certificates appear on the Client tab.

. <<configure-external-monitoring-tool,Configure an external monitoring tool>>, such as Grafana. 

=== Generated certificate from Grid Manager

Use this procedure to add an administrator client certificate if a management interface certificate was not configured and you plan to add a client certificate for Prometheus that uses the generate certificate function in Grid Manager.

.Steps

. In the Grid Manager, select *CONFIGURATION* > *Security* > *Certificates* and then select the *Client* tab.
. Select *Add*.
. Enter a certificate name.
. To access Prometheus metrics using your external monitoring tool, select *Allow prometheus*.
. Select *Continue*.

. For the *Attach certificates* step, select *Generate certificate*.

. Specify the certificate information:

** *Subject* (optional): X.509 subject or distinguished name (DN) of the certificate owner.

** *Days valid*: The number of days the generated certificate is valid, starting at the time it is generated.

** *Add key usage extensions*: If selected (default and recommended), key usage and extended key usage extensions are added to the generated certificate.
+
These extensions define the purpose of the key contained in the certificate.
+
NOTE: Leave this checkbox selected unless you experience connection problems with older clients when certificates include these extensions.

. Select *Generate*. 

. [[client_cert_details]] Select *Client certificate details* to display the certificate metadata and certificate PEM.
+
TIP: You will not be able to view the certificate private key after you close the dialog. Copy or download the key to a safe location.
+
* Select *Copy certificate PEM* to copy the certificate contents for pasting elsewhere.
* Select *Download certificate* to save the certificate file.
+
Specify the certificate file name and download location. Save the file with the extension `.pem`.
+
For example: `storagegrid_certificate.pem`
* Select *Copy private key* to copy the certificate private key for pasting elsewhere.
* Select *Download private key* to save the private key as a file.
+
Specify the private key file name and download location.

. Select *Create* to save the certificate in the Grid Manager.
+
The new certificate appears on the Client tab.

. In the Grid Manager, select *CONFIGURATION* > *Security* > *Certificates* and then select the *Global* tab.
. Select *Management Interface certificate*.
. Select *Use custom certificate*.

. Upload the certificate.pem and private_key.pem files from the <<client_cert_details,client certificate details>> step. There is no need to upload CA bundle.
.. Select *Upload certificate* and then select *Continue*.
.. Upload each certificate file (`.pem`).
.. Select *Save* to save the certificate in the Grid Manager.
+
The new certificate appears on the Management Interface certificate page.

. <<configure-external-monitoring-tool,Configure an external monitoring tool>>, such as Grafana. 

=== [[configure-external-monitoring-tool]]Configure an external monitoring tool

.Steps

. Configure the following settings on your external monitoring tool, such as Grafana.

 .. *Name*: Enter a name for the connection.
+
StorageGRID does not require this information, but you must provide a name to test the connection.

 .. *URL*: Enter the domain name or IP address for the Admin Node. Specify HTTPS and port 9091.
+
For example: `+https://admin-node.example.com:9091+`

 .. Enable *TLS Client Auth* and *With CA Cert*.

 .. Under TLS/SSL Auth Details, copy and paste: +
 * The management interface CA certificate to **CA Cert**
 * The client certificate to **Client Cert**
 * The private key to **Client Key**

 .. *ServerName*: Enter the domain name of the Admin Node.
+
ServerName must match the domain name as it appears in the management interface certificate.

. Save and test the certificate and private key that you copied from StorageGRID or a local file.
+
You can now access the Prometheus metrics from StorageGRID with your external monitoring tool.
+
For information about the metrics, see the link:../monitor/index.html[instructions for monitoring StorageGRID].

== Edit client certificates

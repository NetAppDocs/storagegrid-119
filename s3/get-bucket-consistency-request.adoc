[.lead]
The GET Bucket consistency request allows you to determine the consistency being applied to a particular bucket.

The default consistency is set to guarantee read-after-write for newly created objects.

You must have the s3:GetBucketConsistency permission, or be account root, to complete this operation.

|strong-site
|Guarantees read-after-write consistency for all client requests within a site.

|read-after-new-write
|(Default) Provides read-after-write consistency for new objects and eventual consistency for object updates. Offers high availability and data protection guarantees. Recommended for most cases.

|available

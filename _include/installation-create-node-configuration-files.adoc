== Location for node configuration files

Place the configuration file for each StorageGRID node in the `/etc/storagegrid/nodes` directory on the host where the node will run. For example, if you plan to run one Admin Node, one Gateway Node, and one Storage Node on HostA, you must place three node configuration files in `/etc/storagegrid/nodes` on HostA.

You can create the configuration files directly on each host using a text editor, such as vim or nano, or you can create them elsewhere and move them to each host.

== Naming of node configuration files

The names of the configuration files are significant. The format is `node-name.conf`, where `node-name` is a name you assign to the node. This name appears in the StorageGRID Installer and is used for node maintenance operations, such as node migration.

Node names must follow these rules:

* Must be unique
* Must start with a letter
* Can contain the characters A through Z and a through z
* Can contain the numbers 0 through 9
* Can contain one or more hyphens (-)
* Must be no more than 32 characters, not including the `.conf` extension

Any files in `/etc/storagegrid/nodes` that don't follow these naming conventions will not be parsed by the host service.

If you have a multi-site topology planned for your grid, a typical node naming scheme might be:

`site-nodetype-nodenumber.conf`

For example, you might use `dc1-adm1.conf` for the first Admin Node in Data Center 1, and `dc2-sn3.conf` for the third Storage Node in Data Center 2. However, you can use any scheme you like, as long as all node names follow the naming rules.

== Contents of a node configuration file

A configuration file contains key/value pairs, with one key and one value per line. For each key/value pair, follow these rules:

* The key and the value must be separated by an equal sign (`=`) and optional whitespace.
* The keys can contain no spaces.
* The values can contain embedded spaces.
* Any leading or trailing whitespace is ignored.

The following table defines the values for all supported keys. Each key has one of the following designations:

* *Required*: Required for every node or for the specified node types
* *Best practice*: Optional, although recommended
* *Optional*: Optional for all nodes

=== Admin Network keys

==== ADMIN_IP
[cols="4a,2a" option="header"]
|===
| Value| Designation

| Grid Network IPv4 address of the primary Admin Node for the grid to which this node belongs. Use the same value you specified for GRID_NETWORK_IP for the grid node with NODE_TYPE = VM_Admin_Node and ADMIN_ROLE = Primary. If you omit this parameter, the node attempts to discover a primary Admin Node using mDNS.

Examples:

`1.1.1.1`

`10.224.4.81`
| Required when ADMIN_NETWORK_CONFIG = STATIC.

Optional otherwise.
|===

==== ADMIN_NETWORK_MAC
[cols="4a,2a" option="header"]

==== CUSTOM_TEMPORARY_PASSWORD_HASH
[cols="4a,2a" option="header"]
|===
| Value| Designation

| For the primary Admin Node, set a default temporary password for the StorageGRID Installation API during installation.

*Note*: Set an installation password on the primary Admin Node only. If you attempt to set a password on another  node type, validation of the node configuration file will fail.

Setting this value has no effect when installation has completed.

If this key is omitted, by default no temporary password is set. Alternatively, you can set a temporary password using the StorageGRID Installation API.

Must be a `crypt()` SHA-512 password hash with format `$6$<salt>$<password hash>` for a password of at least 8 and no more than 32 characters.

=== Interfaces key

==== INTERFACE_TARGET_nnnn
[cols="4a,2a" option="header"]
|===
| Value| Designation

| Name and optional description for an extra interface you want to add to this node. You can add multiple extra interfaces to each node.

For _nnnn_, specify a unique number for each INTERFACE_TARGET entry you are adding.

For the value, specify the name of the physical interface on the bare-metal host. Then, optionally, add a comma and provide a description of the interface, which is displayed on the VLAN interfaces page and the HA groups page. 

Example: `INTERFACE_TARGET_0001=ens256, Trunk`

If you add a trunk interface, you must configure a VLAN interface in StorageGRID. If you add an access interface, you can add the interface directly to an HA group; you don't need to configure a VLAN interface. 
| Optional
|===

=== Maximum RAM key

==== MAXIMUM_RAM
[cols="4a,2a" option="header"]
|===
| Value| Designation

| The maximum amount of RAM that this node is allowed to consume. If this key is omitted, the node has no memory restrictions. When setting this field for a production-level node, specify a value that is at least 24 GB and 16 to 32 GB less than the total system RAM.

*Note*: The RAM value affects a node's actual metadata reserved space. See the link:../admin/managing-object-metadata-storage.html[description of what Metadata Reserved Space is].

The format for this field is `_numberunit_`, where `_unit_` can be `b`, `k`, `m`, or `g`.

|===






=== Port remap keys

==== PORT_REMAP
[cols="4a,2a" option="header"]
|===
| Value| Designation

| Remaps any port used by a node for internal grid node communications or external communications. Remapping ports is necessary if enterprise networking policies restrict one or more ports used by StorageGRID, as described in link:../network/internal-grid-node-communications.html[Internal grid node communications] or link:../network/external-communications.html[External communications].

*IMPORTANT*: Don't remap the ports you are planning to use to configure load balancer endpoints.

*Note*: If only PORT_REMAP is set, the mapping that you specify is used for both inbound and outbound communications. If PORT_REMAP_INBOUND is also specified, PORT_REMAP applies only to outbound communications.

The format used is: `_network type_/_protocol_/_default port used by grid node_/_new port_`, where `_network type_` is grid, admin, or client, and `_protocol_` is tcp or udp.

Example: `PORT_REMAP = client/tcp/18082/443`

You can also remap multiple ports using a comma-separated list.

Example: `PORT_REMAP = client/tcp/18082/443, client/tcp/18083/80`
| Optional
|===

==== PORT_REMAP_INBOUND
[cols="4a,2a" option="header"]
|===
| Value| Designation

| Remaps inbound communications to the specified port. If you specify PORT_REMAP_INBOUND but don't specify a value for PORT_REMAP, outbound communications for the port are unchanged.

*IMPORTANT*: Don't remap the ports you are planning to use to configure load balancer endpoints.

The format used is: `_network type_/_protocol_/_remapped port_/_default port used by grid node_`, where `_network type_` is grid, admin, or client, and `_protocol_` is tcp or udp.

Example: `PORT_REMAP_INBOUND = grid/tcp/3022/22`

You can also remap multiple inbound ports using a comma-separated list.

Example: `PORT_REMAP_INBOUND = grid/tcp/3022/22, admin/tcp/3022/22`

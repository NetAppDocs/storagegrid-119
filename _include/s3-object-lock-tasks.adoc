The following lists for grid administrators and tenant users contain the high-level tasks for using the S3 Object Lock feature.

Grid administrator::
* Enable global S3 Object Lock setting for entire StorageGRID system.
* Ensure that information lifecycle management (ILM) policies are _compliant_; that is, they meet the link:../ilm/managing-objects-with-s3-object-lock.html[requirements of buckets with S3 Object Lock enabled].
* As needed, allow a tenant to use Compliance as the retention mode. Otherwise, only Governance mode is allowed.
* As needed, set a maximum retention period for a tenant.

Tenant user::
* Review considerations for buckets and objects with S3 Object Lock.
* As needed, contact grid administrator to enable global S3 Object Lock setting and set permissions.
* Create buckets with S3 Object Lock enabled.
* Optionally, configure default retention settings for a bucket:
** Default retention mode: Governance or Compliance, if allowed by the grid administrator.
** Default retention period: Must be less than or equal to maximum retention period set by grid administrator.
* Use the S3 client application to add objects and optionally set object-specific retention:
** Retention mode. Governance or Compliance, if allowed by the grid administrator.
** Retain Until Date: Must be less than or equal to what is allowed by the maximum retention period set by grid administrator.

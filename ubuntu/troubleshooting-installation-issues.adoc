If any problems occur while installing your StorageGRID system, you can access the installation log files. Technical support might also need to use the installation log files to resolve issues.

The following installation log files are available from the container that is running each node:

* `/var/local/log/install.log` (found on all grid nodes)
* `/var/local/log/gdu-server.log` (found on the primary Admin Node)

The following installation log files are available from the host:

* `/var/log/storagegrid/daemon.log`
* `/var/log/storagegrid/nodes/<node-name>.log`

To learn how to access the log files, see link:../monitor/collecting-log-files-and-system-data.html[Collect log files and system data].

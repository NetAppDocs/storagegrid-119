You must create a tenant account in the Grid Manager for FabricPool use.

Tenant accounts allow client applications to store and retrieve objects on StorageGRID. Each tenant account has its own account ID, authorized groups and users, buckets, and objects.

For details about this task, see link:../admin/creating-tenant-account.html[Create tenant account]. To use the FabricPool setup wizard to complete this task, go to link:use-fabricpool-setup-wizard-steps.html[Access and complete the FabricPool setup wizard].


.Before you begin
* You are signed in to the Grid Manager using a link:../admin/web-browser-requirements.html[supported web browser].
* You have link:../admin/admin-group-permissions.html[specific access permissions].

.Steps
. Select *TENANTS*.

. Select *Create*.

. For the Enter details steps, enter the following information.

. For the Select permissions step:

.. Don't select *Allow platform services*. 
+
FabricPool tenants don't typically need to use platform services, such as CloudMirror replication.

.. Optionally, select *Use own identity source*.
.. Don't select *Allow S3 Select*. 
+
FabricPool tenants don't typically need to use S3 Select. 

.. Optionally, select *Use grid federation connection* to allow the tenant to use a link:../admin/grid-federation-overview.html[grid federation connection] for account clone and cross-grid replication. Then, select the grid federation connection to use.

. For the Define root access step, specify which user will have the initial Root access permission for the tenant account, based on whether your StorageGRID system uses link:../admin/using-identity-federation.html[identity federation], link:../admin/configuring-sso.html[single sign-on (SSO)], or both.

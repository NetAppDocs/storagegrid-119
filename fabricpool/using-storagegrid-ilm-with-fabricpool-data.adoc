You can use this simple example policy as a starting point for your own ILM rules and policy.

This example assumes you are designing the ILM rules and an ILM policy for a StorageGRID system that has four Storage Nodes at a single data center in Denver, Colorado. The FabricPool data in this example uses a bucket named `fabricpool-bucket`.

CAUTION: The following ILM rules and policy are only examples. There are many ways to configure ILM rules. Before activating a new policy, simulate it to confirm it will work as intended to protect content from loss. To learn more, see link:../ilm/index.html[Manage objects with ILM].

CAUTION: To avoid data loss, do not use an ILM rule that will expire or delete FabricPool cloud tier data. Set the retention period to *forever* to ensure that FabricPool objects aren't deleted by StorageGRID ILM.


.Before you begin
* You have reviewed the link:best-practices-ilm.html[best practices for using ILM with FabricPool data].
* You are signed in to the Grid Manager using a link:../admin/web-browser-requirements.html[supported web browser].
* You have the link:../admin/admin-group-permissions.html[ILM or Root access permission].
* If you upgraded to StorageGRID 11.9 from a previous StorageGRID version, you have configured the storage pool you will use. In general, you should create a storage pool for each StorageGRID site you will use to store data. 
+
NOTE: This prerequisite does not apply if you initially installed StorageGRID 11.7 or 11.8. When you initially install either of these versions, storage pools are automatically created for each site.


.Steps

. Create an ILM rule that applies only to the data in `fabricpool-bucket`. This example rule creates erasure-coded copies.
+
[cols="1a,2a" options="header"]
|===
| Rule definition| Example value

| Rule name
| 2 + 1 erasure coding for FabricPool data

| Bucket name
| `fabricpool-bucket`

You could also filter on the FabricPool tenant account.

| Advanced filters
| Object size greater than 0.2 MB.

*Note:* FabricPool only writes 4 MB objects, but you must add an Object size filter because this rule uses erasure coding.

| Reference time
| Ingest time

| Time period and placements
| From Day 0 store forever

Store objects by erasure coding using 2+1 EC scheme at Denver and retain those objects in StorageGRID forever.

CAUTION: To avoid data loss, do not use an ILM rule that will expire or delete FabricPool cloud tier data.

| Ingest behavior
| Balanced
|===

. Create a default ILM rule that will create two replicated copies of any objects not matched by the first rule. Don't select a basic filter (tenant account or bucket name) or any advanced filters.
+
[cols="1a,2a" options="header"]
|===
| Rule definition| Example value

| Rule name
| Two replicated copies

| Bucket name
| _none_

| Advanced filters
| _none_

| Reference time
| Ingest time

| Time period and placements
| From Day 0 store forever

Store objects by replicating 2 copies at Denver.

| Ingest behavior
| Balanced

|===

. Create an ILM policy and select the two rules. Because the replication rule does not use any filters, it can be the default (last) rule for the policy.
. Ingest test objects into the grid.
. Simulate the policy with the test objects to verify the behavior.
. Activate the policy.

When this policy is activated, StorageGRID places object data as follows:

* The data tiered from FabricPool in `fabricpool-bucket` will be erasure-coded using the 2+1 erasure-coding scheme. Two data fragments and one parity fragment will be placed on three different Storage Nodes.
* All objects in all other buckets will be replicated. Two copies will be created and placed on two different Storage Nodes.
* The copies will be maintained in StorageGRID forever. StorageGRID ILM won't delete these objects.

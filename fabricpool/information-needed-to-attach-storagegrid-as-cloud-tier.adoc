Before you can attach StorageGRID as a cloud tier for FabricPool, you must perform configuration steps in StorageGRID and obtain certain values for use in ONTAP.

== What values do I need?

The following table shows the values you must configure in StorageGRID and how those values are used by ONTAP and the DNS server.

| Value| Where value is configured | Where value is used

| Virtual IP (VIP) addresses
| StorageGRID > HA group
| DNS entry

| Port
| StorageGRID > Load balancer endpoint
| ONTAP System Manager > Add Cloud Tier

| SSL certificate
| StorageGRID > Load balancer endpoint
| ONTAP System Manager > Add Cloud Tier

| Server name (FQDN)
| StorageGRID > Load balancer endpoint
| DNS entry

| Access key ID and secret access key
| StorageGRID > Tenant and bucket
| ONTAP System Manager > Add Cloud Tier

| Bucket/Container name

== How do I get these values?
Depending on your requirements, you can do either of the following to obtain the information you need:

* Use the link:use-fabricpool-setup-wizard.html[FabricPool setup wizard]. The FabricPool setup wizard helps you to quickly configure the required values in StorageGRID and outputs a file that you can use to configure ONTAP System Manager. The wizard guides you through the required steps and helps to make sure your settings conform to StorageGRID and FabricPool best practices.

* Configure each item manually. Then, enter the values into ONTAP System Manager or the ONTAP CLI. Follow these steps:

Before using StorageGRID with a FabricPool workload, you must create an S3 bucket for your FabricPool data. You also need to obtain an access key and secret access key for the tenant account you will use for FabricPool.

For details about this task, see link:../tenant/creating-s3-bucket.html[Create S3 bucket] and link:../tenant/creating-your-own-s3-access-keys.html[Create your own S3 access keys]. To use the FabricPool setup wizard to complete this task, go to link:use-fabricpool-setup-wizard-steps.html[Access and complete the FabricPool setup wizard].

.Before you begin
* You have created a tenant account for FabricPool use.
* You have Root access to the tenant account.

.Steps
. Sign in to the Tenant Manager.
+
You can do either of the following:

 ** From the Tenant Accounts page in the Grid Manager, select the *Sign in* link for the tenant, and enter your credentials.
 ** Enter the URL for the tenant account in a web browser, and enter your credentials.

. Create an S3 bucket for FabricPool data.
+
You must create a unique bucket for each ONTAP cluster you plan to use.

 .. Select *View buckets* from the dashboard, or select  *STORAGE (S3)* > *Buckets*.
 .. Select *Create bucket*.
 .. Enter the name of the StorageGRID bucket you want to use with FabricPool. For example, `fabricpool-bucket`.
+
TIP: You can't change the bucket name after creating the bucket.
  
.. Select the region for this bucket.
+
By default, all buckets are created in the `us-east-1` region.

.. Select *Continue*.

.. Select *Create bucket*.
+
NOTE: Don't select *Enable object versioning* for the FabricPool bucket. Similarly, don't edit a FabricPool bucket to use *Available* or a non-default consistency. The recommended bucket consistency for FabricPool buckets is *Read-after-new-write*, which is the default consistency for a new bucket. 

. Create an access key and a secret access key.
 .. Select *STORAGE (S3)* > *My access keys*.
 .. Select *Create key*.
 .. Select *Create access key*.
 .. Copy the access key ID and the secret access key to a safe location, or select *Download .csv* to save a spreadsheet file containing the access key ID and secret access key.
+
You will enter these values in ONTAP when you configure StorageGRID as a FabricPool cloud tier.
+
TIP: If you generate a new access key and secret access key in StorageGRID in the future, enter the new keys into ONTAP before deleting the old values from StorageGRID. Otherwise, ONTAP might temporarily lose its access to StorageGRID.

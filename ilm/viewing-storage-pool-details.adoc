You can view the details of a storage pool to determine where the storage pool is used and to see which nodes and storage grades are included.

.Before you begin
* You are signed in to the Grid Manager using a link:../admin/web-browser-requirements.html[supported web browser].
* You have link:../admin/admin-group-permissions.html[specific access permissions].

.Steps
. Select *ILM* > *Storage pools*.
+
The Storage pools table includes the following information for each storage pool that includes Storage Nodes:
+
* *Name*: The unique display name of the storage pool.
* *Node count*: The number of nodes in the storage pool.
* *Storage usage*: The percentage of the total usable space that has been used for object data on this node. This value does not include object metadata.
* *Total capacity*: The size of the storage pool, which equals the total amount of usable space for object data for all nodes in the storage pool.
* *ILM usage*: How the storage pool is currently being used. A storage pool might be unused or it might be used in one or more ILM rules, erasure-coding profiles, or both.

. To view details for a specific storage pool, select its name.
+
The details page for the storage pool appears.

. View the *Nodes* tab to learn about the Storage Nodes included in the storage pool.
+
The table includes the following information for each node:

* Node name
* Site name
* Storage grade
* Storage usage: The percentage of the total usable space for object data that has been used for the Storage Node.
+
NOTE: The same Storage usage (%) value is also shown in the Storage Used - Object Data chart for each Storage Node (select *NODES* > *_Storage Node_* > *Storage*).

. View the *ILM usage* tab to determine if the storage pool is currently being used in any ILM rules or erasure-coding profiles.

. Optionally, go to the *ILM rules page* to learn about and manage any rules that use the storage pool.

If you plan to use a Cloud Storage Pool to move objects out of the StorageGRID system, you must review the considerations for configuring and using Cloud Storage Pools.

== General considerations

* In general, cloud archival storage, such as Amazon S3 Glacier or Azure Blob storage, is an inexpensive place to store object data. However, the costs to retrieve data from cloud archival storage are relatively high. To achieve the lowest overall cost, you must consider when and how often you will access the objects in the Cloud Storage Pool. Using a Cloud Storage Pool is recommended only for content that you expect to access infrequently.
* Using Cloud Storage Pools with FabricPool is not supported because of the added latency to retrieve an object from the Cloud Storage Pool target.
* Objects with S3 Object Lock enabled can't be placed in Cloud Storage Pools.
* If the destination S3 bucket for a Cloud Storage Pool has S3 Object Lock enabled, the attempt to configure bucket replication (PutBucketReplication) will fail with an AccessDenied error.
* The following platform, authentication, and protocol combinations with S3 Object lock aren't supported for Cloud Storage Pools:
+
** *Platforms*: Google Cloud Platform and Azure
** *Authentication types*: IAM Roles Anywhere and anonymous access 
** *Protocol*: HTTP

== Considerations for the ports used for Cloud Storage Pools

To ensure that the ILM rules can move objects to and from the specified Cloud Storage Pool, you must configure the network or networks that contain your system's Storage Nodes. You must ensure that the following ports can communicate with the Cloud Storage Pool.

By default, Cloud Storage Pools use the following ports:

* *80*: For endpoint URIs that begin with http
* *443*: For endpoint URIs that begin with https

You can specify a different port when you create or edit a Cloud Storage Pool.

If you use a non-transparent proxy server, you must also link:../admin/configuring-storage-proxy-settings.html[configure a storage proxy] to allow messages to be sent to external endpoints, such as an endpoint on the internet.

== Considerations for costs

Access to storage in the cloud using a Cloud Storage Pool requires network connectivity to the cloud. You must consider the cost of the network infrastructure you will use to access the cloud and provision it appropriately, based on the amount of data you expect to move between StorageGRID and the cloud using the Cloud Storage Pool.

When StorageGRID connects to the external Cloud Storage Pool endpoint, it issues various requests to monitor connectivity and to ensure it can perform the required operations. While some additional costs will be associated with these requests, the cost of monitoring a Cloud Storage Pool should only be a small fraction of the overall cost of storing objects in S3 or Azure.

More significant costs might be incurred if you need to move objects from an external Cloud Storage Pool endpoint back to StorageGRID. Objects might be moved back to StorageGRID in either of these cases:

* The only copy of the object is in a Cloud Storage Pool and you decide to store the object in StorageGRID instead. In this case, you reconfigure your ILM rules and policy. When ILM evaluation occurs, StorageGRID issues multiple requests to retrieve the object from the Cloud Storage Pool. StorageGRID then creates the specified number of replicated or erasure-coded copies locally. After the object is moved back to StorageGRID, the copy in the Cloud Storage Pool is deleted.
* Objects are lost because of Storage Node failure. If the only remaining copy of an object is in a Cloud Storage Pool, StorageGRID temporarily restores the object and creates a new copy on the recovered Storage Node.

NOTE: When objects are moved back to StorageGRID from a Cloud Storage Pool, StorageGRID issues multiple requests to the Cloud Storage Pool endpoint for each object. Before moving large numbers of objects, contact technical support for help in estimating the time frame and associated costs.

== S3: Permissions required for the Cloud Storage Pool bucket

The policies for the external S3 bucket used for a Cloud Storage Pool must grant StorageGRID permission to move an object to the bucket, get an object's status, restore an object from Glacier storage when required, and more. Ideally, StorageGRID should have full-control access to the bucket (`s3:*`); however, if this is not possible, the bucket policy must grant the following S3 permissions to StorageGRID:

* `s3:AbortMultipartUpload`
* `s3:DeleteObject`
* `s3:GetObject`
* `s3:ListBucket`
* `s3:ListBucketMultipartUploads`
* `s3:ListMultipartUploadParts`
* `s3:PutObject`
* `s3:RestoreObject`

== S3: Considerations for the external bucket's lifecycle

The movement of objects between StorageGRID and the external S3 bucket specified in the Cloud Storage Pool is controlled by ILM rules and the active ILM policies in StorageGRID. In contrast, the transition of objects from the external S3 bucket specified in the Cloud Storage Pool to Amazon S3 Glacier or S3 Glacier Deep Archive (or to a storage solution that implements the Glacier storage class) is controlled by that bucket's lifecycle configuration.

If you want to transition objects from the Cloud Storage Pool, you must create the appropriate lifecycle configuration on the external S3 bucket, and you must use a storage solution that implements the Glacier storage class and supports the S3 RestoreObject API.

For example, suppose you want all objects that are moved from StorageGRID to the Cloud Storage Pool to be transitioned to Amazon S3 Glacier storage immediately. You would create a lifecycle configuration on the external S3 bucket that specifies a single action (*Transition*) as follows:

----
<LifecycleConfiguration>
  <Rule>
    <ID>Transition Rule</ID>
    <Filter>
       <Prefix></Prefix>
    </Filter>
    <Status>Enabled</Status>
    <Transition>
      <Days>0</Days>
      <StorageClass>GLACIER</StorageClass>
    </Transition>
  </Rule>
</LifecycleConfiguration>
----

This rule would transition all bucket objects to Amazon S3 Glacier on the day they were created (that is, on the day they were moved from StorageGRID to the Cloud Storage Pool).

CAUTION: When configuring the external bucket's lifecycle, never use *Expiration* actions to define when objects expire. Expiration actions cause the external storage system to delete expired objects. If you later attempt to access an expired object from StorageGRID, the deleted object will not be found.

If you want to transition objects in the Cloud Storage Pool to S3 Glacier Deep Archive (instead of to Amazon S3 Glacier), specify `<StorageClass>DEEP_ARCHIVE</StorageClass>` in the bucket lifecycle. However, be aware that you can't use the `Expedited` tier to restore objects from S3 Glacier Deep Archive.

== Azure: Considerations for Access tier

When you configure an Azure storage account, you can set the default Access tier to Hot or Cool. When creating a storage account for use with a Cloud Storage Pool, you should use the Hot tier as the default tier. Even though StorageGRID immediately sets the tier to Archive when it moves objects to the Cloud Storage Pool, using a default setting of Hot ensures that you will not be charged an early deletion fee for objects removed from the Cool tier before the 30-day minimum.

== Azure: Lifecycle management not supported

Don't use Azure Blob storage lifecycle management for the container used with a Cloud Storage Pool. The lifecycle operations might interfere with Cloud Storage Pool operations.

You can view the details for an erasure-coding profile and rename a profile if needed. You can deactivate an erasure-coding profile if it is not currently used in any ILM rules.

.Before you begin

* You are signed in to the Grid Manager using a link:../admin/web-browser-requirements.html[supported web browser].
* You have the link:../admin/admin-group-permissions.html[required access permissions].

== View erasure-coding profile details

You can view the details of an erasure-coding profile to determine its status, the erasure-coding scheme used, and other information.

.Steps

. Select *CONFIGURATION* > *System* > *Erasure coding*.

. Select the profile. The detail page for the profile appears.

. Optionally, view the ILM rules tab for a list of ILM rules that use the profile, and the ILM policies that use those rules.

. Optionally, view the Storage Nodes tab for details about each Storage Node in the profile's storage pool, such as the site where it's located and the storage usage.

== Rename an erasure-coding profile

You might want to rename an erasure-coding profile to make it more obvious what the profile does.

.Steps

. Select *CONFIGURATION* > *System* > *Erasure coding*.

. Select the profile you want to rename.

. Select *Rename*.

. Enter a unique name for the erasure-coding profile.
+
The erasure-coding profile name is appended to the storage pool name in the placement instruction for an ILM rule.
+
NOTE: Erasure-coding profile names must be unique. A validation error occurs if you use the name of an existing profile, even if that profile has been deactivated.

. Select *Save*.

== Deactivate an erasure-coding profile

You can deactivate an erasure-coding profile if you no longer plan to use it and if the profile is not currently used in any ILM rules.

TIP: Confirm that no erasure-coded data repair operations or decommission procedures are in process. An error message is returned if you attempt to deactivate an erasure-coding profile while either of these operations are in progress.

.About this task
StorageGRID prevents you from deactivating an erasure-coding profile if either of the following is true:

* The erasure-coding profile is currently used in an ILM rule.
* The erasure-coding profile is no longer used in any ILM rules, but object data and parity fragments for the profile still exist.

.Steps

. Select *CONFIGURATION* > *System* > *Erasure coding*.

. On the Active tab, review the *Status* column to confirm that the erasure-coding profile you want to deactivate is not used in any ILM rules.
+
You can't deactivate an erasure-coding profile if it is used in any ILM rule. In the example, the 2+1 Data Center 1 profile is used in at least one ILM rule.

. If the profile is used in an ILM rule, follow these steps:
.. Select *ILM* > *Rules*.
.. Select each rule and review the retention diagram to determine if the rule uses the erasure-coding profile you want to deactivate.
.. If the ILM rule uses the erasure-coding profile you want to deactivate, determine if the rule is used in any ILM policy.
.. Complete the additional steps in the table, based on where the erasure-coding profile is used.

| Where has the profile been used?| Additional steps to perform before deactivating the profile| Refer to these additional instructions

| Never used in any ILM rule
| No additional steps required. Continue with this procedure.
| _None_

| In an ILM rule that has never been used in any ILM policy
| 
. Edit or delete all affected ILM rules. If you edit the rule, remove all placements that use the erasure-coding profile.
. Continue with this procedure.

| In an ILM rule that is currently in an active ILM policy
| 
. Clone the policy.
. Remove the ILM rule that uses the erasure-coding profile.
. Add one or more new ILM rules to ensure objects are protected.
. Save, simulate, and activate the new policy.
. Wait for the new policy to be applied and for existing objects to be moved to new locations based on the new rules you added.
+
*Note:* Depending on the number of objects and the size of your StorageGRID system, it might take weeks or even months for ILM operations to move the objects to new locations, based on the new ILM rules.
+
While you can safely attempt to deactivate an erasure-coding profile while it is still associated with data, the deactivation operation will fail. An error message will inform you if the profile is not yet ready to be deactivated.

. Edit or delete the rule you removed from the policy. If you edit the rule, remove all placements that use the erasure-coding profile.
. Continue with this procedure.

| In an ILM rule that is currently in an ILM policy
| 
. Edit the policy.
. Remove the ILM rule that uses the erasure-coding profile.
. Add one or more new ILM rules to ensure all objects are protected.
. Save the policy.
. Edit or delete the rule you removed from the policy. If you edit the rule, remove all placements that use the erasure-coding profile.
. Continue with this procedure.

|===

 .. Refresh the Erasure-Coding Profiles page to ensure that the profile is not used in an ILM rule.

. If the profile is not used in an ILM rule, select the radio button and select *Deactivate*. The Deactivate erasure-coding profile dialog box appears.
+
TIP: You can select multiple profiles to deactivate at the same time, as long as each profile is not used in any rule.

. If you are sure you want to deactivate the profile, select *Deactivate*.

.Results

* If StorageGRID is able to deactivate the erasure-coding profile, its status is Deactivated. You can no longer select this profile for any ILM rule. You can't reactivate a deactivated profile.

* If StorageGRID is not able to deactivate the profile, an error message appears. For example, an error message appears if object data is still associated with this profile. You might need to wait several weeks before trying the deactivation process again.

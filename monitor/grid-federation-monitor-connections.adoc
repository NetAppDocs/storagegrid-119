[.lead]
You can monitor basic information about all link:../admin/grid-federation-overview.html[grid federation connections], detailed information about a specific connection, or Prometheus metrics about cross-grid replication operations. You can monitor a connection from either grid.

.Before you begin

* You are signed in to the Grid Manager on either grid using a link:../admin/web-browser-requirements.html[supported web browser].
* You have the link:../admin/admin-group-permissions.html[Root access permission] for the grid you are signed in to. 

== View all connections

The Grid federation page shows basic information about all grid federation connections and about all tenant accounts that are permitted to use grid federation connections.

.Steps

. Select *CONFIGURATION* > *System* > *Grid federation*.
+
The Grid federation page appears. 

. To see basic information for all connections on this grid, select the *Connections* tab.
+
From this tab, you can:

** link:../admin/grid-federation-create-connection.html[Create a new connection].
** Select an existing connection to link:../admin/grid-federation-manage-connection.html[edit or test].

+

. To see basic information for all tenant accounts on this grid that have the *Use grid federation connection* permission, select the *Permitted tenants* tab.
+
From this tab, you can:

** link:../monitor/monitoring-tenant-activity.html[View the details page for each permitted tenant].
** View the details page for each connection. See <<view-specific-connection, View a specific connection>>.
** Select a permitted tenant and link:../admin/grid-federation-manage-tenants.html[remove the permission].
** Check for cross-grid replication errors and clear the last error, if any. See link:../admin/grid-federation-troubleshoot.html[Troubleshoot grid federation errors].
+

== [[view-specific-connection]]View a specific connection
You can view details for a specific grid federation connection.

.Steps

. Select either tab from the Grid federation page and then select the connection name from the table.
+
From the details page for the connection, you can:

** See basic status information about the connection, including the local and remote hostnames, port, and connection status.

** Select a connection to link:../admin/grid-federation-manage-connection.html[edit, test, or remove].

. When viewing a specific connection, select the *Permitted tenants* tab to view details about the permitted tenants for the connection.
+
From this tab, you can:

** link:../monitor/monitoring-tenant-activity.html[View the details page for each permitted tenant]. 

** link:../admin/grid-federation-manage-tenants.html[Remove a tenant's permission] to use the connection.

** Check for cross-grid replication errors and clear the last error. See link:../admin/grid-federation-troubleshoot.html[Troubleshoot grid federation errors].
+

. When viewing a specific connection, select the *Certificates* tab to view the system-generated server and client certificates for this connection.
+
From this tab, you can:

** link:../admin/grid-federation-manage-connection.html[Rotate connection certificates].

== Review cross-grid replication metrics

You can use the Cross-Grid Replication dashboard in Grafana to view Prometheus metrics about cross-grid replication operations on your grid.

.Steps

. From the Grid Manager, select *SUPPORT* > *Tools* > *Metrics*.
+
NOTE: The tools available on the Metrics page are intended for use by technical support. Some features and menu items within these tools are intentionally non-functional and are subject to change. See the list of link:../monitor/commonly-used-prometheus-metrics.html[commonly used Prometheus metrics].

. In the Grafana section of the page, select *Cross Grid Replication*. 
+

For detailed instructions, see link:../monitor/reviewing-support-metrics.html[Review support metrics].

. To retry replication of objects that failed to replicate, see link:../admin/grid-federation-retry-failed-replication.html[Identify and retry failed replication operations].

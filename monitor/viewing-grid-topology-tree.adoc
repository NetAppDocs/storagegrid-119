The Grid Topology tree provides access to detailed information about StorageGRID system elements, including sites, grid nodes, services, and components. In most cases, you only need to access the Grid Topology tree when instructed in the documentation or when working with technical support.

To access the Grid Topology tree, select *SUPPORT* > *Tools* > *Grid topology*.

To expand or collapse the Grid Topology tree, click image:../media/nms_tree_expand.gif[plus sign icon] or image:../media/nms_tree_collapse.gif[minus sign icon] at the site, node, or service level. To expand or collapse all items in the entire site or in each node, hold down the *<Ctrl>* key and click.


== StorageGRID attributes

Attributes report values and statuses for many of the functions of the StorageGRID system. Attribute values are available for each grid node, each site, and the entire grid.

StorageGRID attributes are used in several places in the Grid Manager:

* *Nodes page*: Many of the values shown on the Nodes page are StorageGRID attributes. (Prometheus metrics are also shown on the Nodes pages.)
* *Grid Topology tree*: Attribute values are shown in the Grid Topology tree (*SUPPORT* > *Tools* > *Grid topology*).
* *Events*: System events occur when certain attributes record an error or fault condition for a node, including errors such as network errors.

=== Attribute values

Attributes are reported on a best-effort basis and are approximately correct. Attribute updates can be lost under some circumstances, such as the crash of a service or the failure and rebuild of a grid node.

In addition, propagation delays might slow the reporting of attributes. Updated values for most attributes are sent to the StorageGRID system at fixed intervals. It can take several minutes before an update is visible in the system, and two attributes that change more or less simultaneously can be reported at slightly different times.

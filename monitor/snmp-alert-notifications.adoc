If you want StorageGRID to send SNMP notifications when alerts occur, you must enable the StorageGRID SNMP agent and configure one or more trap destinations.

You can use the *CONFIGURATION* > *Monitoring* > *SNMP agent* option in the Grid Manager or the SNMP endpoints for the Grid Management API to enable and configure the StorageGRID SNMP agent. The SNMP agent supports all three versions of the SNMP protocol.

To learn how to configure the SNMP agent, see link:using-snmp-monitoring.html[Use SNMP monitoring].

After you configure the StorageGRID SNMP agent, two types of event-driven notifications can be sent:

* Traps are notifications sent by the SNMP agent that don't require acknowledgment by the management system. Traps serve to notify the management system that something has happened within StorageGRID, such as an alert being triggered. Traps are supported in all three versions of SNMP.

* Informs are similar to traps, but they require acknowledgment by the management system. If the SNMP agent does not receive an acknowledgment within a certain amount of time, it resends the inform until an acknowledgment is received or the maximum retry value has been reached. Informs are supported in SNMPv2c and SNMPv3.

Trap and inform notifications are sent when a default or custom alert is triggered at any severity level. To suppress SNMP notifications for an alert, you must configure a silence for the alert. See link:silencing-alert-notifications.html[Silence alert notifications].

If your StorageGRID deployment includes multiple Admin Nodes, the primary Admin Node is the preferred sender for alert notifications, AutoSupport packages, and SNMP traps and informs. If the primary Admin Node becomes unavailable, notifications are temporarily sent by other Admin Nodes. See link:../primer/what-admin-node-is.html[What is an Admin Node?].

Many features and operations within SANtricity System Manager such as upgrading firmware don't apply to monitoring your StorageGRID appliance. To avoid issues, always follow the hardware maintenance instructions for your appliance. To upgrade SANtricity firmware, see the https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/storagegrid-appliances/landing-maintain-hdwr/index.html[Maintenance configuration procedures^] for your storage appliance.

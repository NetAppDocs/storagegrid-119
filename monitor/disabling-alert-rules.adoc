.About this task
When an alert rule is disabled, its expressions aren't evaluated and no alerts are triggered.

CAUTION: In general, disabling a default alert rule is not recommended. If an alert rule is disabled, you might not detect an underlying problem until it prevents a critical operation from completing.

.Steps

+
The Alert Rules page appears.

. Select the radio button for the alert rule you want to disable or enable.
. Select *Edit rule*.
+
The Edit Rule dialog box appears.

. Select or clear the *Enabled* checkbox to determine if this alert rule is currently enabled.
+
If an alert rule is disabled, its expressions aren't evaluated and no alerts are triggered.
+
NOTE: If you disable the alert rule for a current alert, you must wait a few minutes for the alert to no longer display as an active alert.

. Select *Save*.
+
*Disabled* appears in the *Status* column.

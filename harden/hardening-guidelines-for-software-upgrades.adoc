You must keep your StorageGRID system and related services up to date to defend against attacks.

== Upgrades to StorageGRID software

Whenever possible, you should upgrade StorageGRID software to the most recent major release or to the previous major release. Keeping StorageGRID up to date helps reduce the amount of time that known vulnerabilities are active and reduces the overall attack surface area. In addition, the most recent releases of StorageGRID often contain security hardening features that aren't included in earlier releases.

Consult the https://imt.netapp.com/matrix/#welcome[NetApp Interoperability Matrix Tool^] (IMT) to determine which version of StorageGRID software you should be using. When a hotfix is required, NetApp prioritizes creating updates for the most recent releases. Some patches might not be compatible with earlier releases. 

* To download the most recent StorageGRID releases and hotfixes, go to https://mysupport.netapp.com/site/products/all/details/storagegrid/downloads-tab[NetApp Downloads: StorageGRID^]. 
* To upgrade StorageGRID software, see the link:../upgrade/performing-upgrade.html[upgrade instructions]. 
* To apply a hotfix, see the link:../maintain/storagegrid-hotfix-procedure.html[StorageGRID hotfix procedure].

== Upgrades to external services

External services can have vulnerabilities that affect StorageGRID indirectly. You should ensure that the services that StorageGRID depends on are kept up to date. These services include LDAP, KMS (or KMIP server), DNS, and NTP.

For a list of supported versions, see the https://imt.netapp.com/matrix/#welcome[NetApp Interoperability Matrix Tool^].

== Upgrades to hypervisors

If your StorageGRID nodes are running on VMware or another hypervisor, you must ensure that the hypervisor software and firmware are up to date.

For a list of supported versions, see the https://imt.netapp.com/matrix/#welcome[NetApp Interoperability Matrix Tool^].

== *Upgrades to Linux nodes*

If your StorageGRID nodes are using Linux host platforms, you must ensure that security updates and kernel updates are applied to the host OS. Additionally, you must apply firmware updates to vulnerable hardware when these updates become available.

[.lead]
Some features and capabilities were removed or deprecated in this release. Review these items to understand whether you need to update client applications or modify your configuration before you upgrade.

== Definitions

Deprecated:: The feature *should not* be used in new production environments. Existing production environments can continue using the feature.
End of Life:: Last shipped version that supports the feature. In some cases, documentation for the feature might be removed at this stage.
Removed:: First version that *does not* support the feature.

== StorageGRID end of feature support

Deprecated features will be removed in N+2 major versions. For example, if a feature is deprecated in version N (for example, 6.3), the last version where the feature will exist is N+1 (for example, 6.4). Version N+2 (for example, 6.5) is the first release when the feature doesn't exist in the product.

See the https://mysupport.netapp.com/site/info/version-support[Software Version Support page^] for additional information.

NOTE: In certain situations, NetApp might end support for particular features sooner than indicated.

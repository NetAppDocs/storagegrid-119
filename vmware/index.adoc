[role="quick-margin-para"]
Deploy grid nodes. When you deploy grid nodes, they are created as part of the StorageGRID system and connected to one or more networks.

* Use the VMware vSphere Web Client, a .vmdk file, and a set of .ovf file templates to link:collecting-information-about-your-deployment-environment.html[deploy the software-based nodes as virtual machines (VMs)] on the servers you prepared in step 1.

* To deploy StorageGRID appliance nodes, follow the https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/storagegrid-appliances/installconfig/index.html[Quick start for hardware installation^].

[role="quick-margin-para"]
When all nodes have been deployed, use the Grid Manager to link:navigating-to-grid-manager.html[configure the grid and complete the installation].

== Automate the installation

To save time and provide consistency, you can automate the deployment and configuration of grid nodes and the configuration of the StorageGRID system.

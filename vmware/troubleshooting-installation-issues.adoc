If any problems occur while installing your StorageGRID system, you can access the installation log files.

The following are the main installation log files, which technical support might need to resolve issues.

* `/var/local/log/install.log` (found on all grid nodes)
* `/var/local/log/gdu-server.log` (found on the primary Admin Node)

== Virtual machine resource reservation requires adjustment

OVF files include a resource reservation designed to ensure that each grid node has sufficient RAM and CPU to operate efficiently. If you create virtual machines by deploying these OVF files on VMware and the predefined number of resources aren't available, the virtual machines will not start.

.About this task

If you are certain that the VM host has sufficient resources for each grid node, manually adjust the resources allocated for each virtual machine, and then try starting the virtual machines.

.Steps

. In the VMware vSphere Hypervisor client tree, select the virtual machine that is not started.
. Right‚Äêclick the virtual machine, and select *Edit Settings*.
. From the Virtual Machines Properties window, select the *Resources* tab.
. Adjust the resources allocated to the virtual machine:
 .. Select *CPU*, and then use the Reservation slider to adjust the MHz reserved for this virtual machine.
 .. Select *Memory*, and then use the Reservation slider to adjust the MB reserved for this virtual machine.
. Click *OK*.
. Repeat as required for other virtual machines hosted on the same VM host.

== Temporary installation password was disabled

When you deploy a VMware node, you can optionally specify a temporary installation password. You must have this password to access the VM console or use SSH before the new node joins the grid.

If you opted to disable the temporary installation password, you must perform additional steps to debug installation issues.

You can do either of the following:

* Redeploy the VM but specify a temporary installation password so you can access the console or use SSH to debug installation issues. 

* Use vCenter to set the password:

. Power off the VM.
. Go to *VM*, select the *Configure* tab, and select *vApp Options*.
. Specify type of temporary installation password to set:

** Select *CUSTOM_TEMPORARY_PASSWORD* to set a custom temporary password.
** Select *TEMPORARY_PASSWORD_TYPE* to use the node name as the temporary password.

. Select *Set Value*.
. Set the temporary password:
** Change *CUSTOM_TEMPORARY_PASSWORD* to a custom password value.
** Update the *TEMPORARY_PASSWORD_TYPE* with the *Use node name* value.

. Restart the VM to apply the new password.

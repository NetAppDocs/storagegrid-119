* Learn about link:../primer/storagegrid-architecture-and-network-topology.html[StorageGRID architecture and network topology].
* Learn about the specifics of link:../network/index.html[StorageGRID networking].
* Gather and prepare the link:required-materials.html[Required information and materials].
* Prepare the required link:cpu-and-ram-requirements.html[CPU and RAM].
* Provide for link:storage-and-performance-requirements.html[storage and performance requirements].
* link:how-host-wide-settings-change.html[Prepare the Linux servers] that will host your StorageGRID nodes.

[role="quick-margin-para"]
Deploy grid nodes. When you deploy grid nodes, they are created as part of the StorageGRID system and connected to one or more networks.

[role="quick-margin-list"]
* To deploy software-based grid nodes on the hosts you prepared in step 1, use the Linux command line and link:creating-node-configuration-files.html[node configuration files].
* To deploy StorageGRID appliance nodes, follow the https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/storagegrid-appliances/installconfig/index.html[Quick start for hardware installation^].

[role="quick-margin-para"]
When all nodes have been deployed, use the Grid Manager to link:navigating-to-grid-manager.html[configure the grid and complete the installation].

== Automate the installation

To save time and provide consistency, you can automate the installation of the StorageGRID host service and the configuration of grid nodes.

* Use a standard orchestration framework such as Ansible, Puppet, or Chef to automate:
** Installation of RHEL
** Configuration of networking and storage
** Installation of the container engine and the StorageGRID host service
** Deployment of virtual grid nodes

See link:automating-installation.html#automate-the-installation-and-configuration-of-the-storagegrid-host-service[Automate the installation and configuration of the StorageGRID host service].

* After you deploy grid nodes, link:automating-installation.html#automate-the-configuration-of-storagegrid[automate the configuration of the StorageGRID system] using the Python configuration script provided in the installation archive.

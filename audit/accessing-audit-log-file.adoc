* You must have the `Passwords.txt` file.
* You must know the IP address of an Admin Node.

.Steps

. Log in to an Admin Node:
.. Enter the following command: `ssh admin@_primary_Admin_Node_IP_`
.. Enter the password listed in the `Passwords.txt` file.
.. Enter the following command to switch to root: `su -`
.. Enter the password listed in the `Passwords.txt` file.
+
When you are logged in as root, the prompt changes from `$` to `#`.

. Go to the directory containing the audit log files:
+
`cd /var/local/log`
. View the current or a saved audit log file, as required.

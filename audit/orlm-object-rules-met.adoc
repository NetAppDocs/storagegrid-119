| The CBID of the object.

| CSIZ
| Content size
| The size of the object in bytes.

| LOCS
| Locations
| The storage location of object data within the StorageGRID system. The value for LOCS is "" if the object has no locations (for example, it has been deleted).

CLEC: for erasure-coded objects, the erasure-coding profile ID and the erasure coding group ID that is applied to the object's data.

CLDI: for replicated objects, the LDR node ID and the volume ID of the object's location.

CLNL: ARC node ID of the object's location if the object data is archived.

| PATH
| S3 Bucket/Key
| The S3 bucket name and S3 key name.

| RSLT
| Result

SUCS: The ILM operation was successful.

| RULE

| SEGC
| Container UUID
| UUID of the container for the segmented object. This value is available only if the object is segmented.

| STAT
| Status
| The status of ILM operation.

DONE: ILM operations against the object have completed.

DFER: The object has been marked for future ILM re-evaluation.

PRGD: The object has been deleted from the StorageGRID system.

NLOC: The object data can no longer be found in the StorageGRID system. This status might indicate that all copies of object data are missing or damaged.

| UUID
| Universally Unique Identifier
| The identifier of the object within the StorageGRID system.

| VSID
| Version ID
| The version ID of a new object created in a versioned bucket. Operations on buckets and objects in unversioned buckets don't include this field.

|===

The ORLM audit message can be issued more than once for a single object. For instance, it is issued whenever one of the following events occur:

* ILM rules for the object are satisfied forever.
* ILM rules for the object are satisfied for this epoch.
* ILM rules have deleted the object.
* The background verification process detects that a copy of replicated object data is corrupt. The StorageGRID system performs an ILM evaluation to replace the corrupt object.

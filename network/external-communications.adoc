[.lead]
Clients need to communicate with grid nodes to ingest and retrieve content. The ports used depends on the object storage protocols chosen. These ports need to be accessible to the client.

== Restricted access to ports

If enterprise networking policies restrict access to any of the ports, you can do one of the following:

* Use link:../admin/configuring-load-balancer-endpoints.html[load balancer endpoints] to allow access on user-defined ports.
* Remap ports when deploying nodes. However, you should not remap load balancer endpoints. See the information about port remapping for your StorageGRID node:

** link:../rhel/creating-node-configuration-files.html#port-remap-keys[Port remap keys for StorageGRID on Red Hat Enterprise Linux]

** link:../ubuntu/creating-node-configuration-files.html#port-remap-keys[Port remap keys for StorageGRID on Ubuntu or Debian]

** link:../vmware/deploying-storagegrid-node-as-virtual-machine.html#vmware-remap-ports[Remap ports for StorageGRID on VMware]

** https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/storagegrid-appliances/installconfig/optional-remapping-network-ports-for-appliance.html[Optional: Remap network ports for appliance^]

== Ports used for external communications

The following table shows the ports used for traffic into the nodes.

NOTE: This list does not include ports that might be configured as link:../admin/configuring-load-balancer-endpoints.html[load balancer endpoints].

[.lead]
You access the Tenant Manager by entering the URL for the tenant into the address bar of a link:../admin/web-browser-requirements.html[supported web browser].

.Before you begin

* You have your login credentials.
* You have a URL for accessing the Tenant Manager, as supplied by your grid administrator. The URL will look like one of these examples:
+
`\https://FQDN_or_Admin_Node_IP/`
+
`\https://FQDN_or_Admin_Node_IP:port/`
+
`\https://FQDN_or_Admin_Node_IP/?accountId=20-digit-account-id`
+
`\https://FQDN_or_Admin_Node_IP:port/?accountId=20-digit-account-id`

+
The URL always includes a fully qualified domain name (FQDN), the IP address of an Admin Node, or the virtual IP address of an HA group of Admin Nodes. It might also include a port number, the 20-digit tenant account ID, or both.

* If the URL does not include the tenant's 20-digit account ID, you have this account ID.
* You are using a link:../admin/web-browser-requirements.html[supported web browser].
* Cookies are enabled in your web browser.
* You belong to a user group that has link:tenant-management-permissions.html[specific access permissions]. 

.Steps
. Launch a link:../admin/web-browser-requirements.html[supported web browser].
. In the browser's address bar, enter the URL for accessing Tenant Manager.
. If you are prompted with a security alert, install the certificate using the browser's installation wizard.
. Sign in to the Tenant Manager.
+
The sign-in screen that appears depends on the URL you entered and whether single sign-on (SSO) has been configured for StorageGRID.

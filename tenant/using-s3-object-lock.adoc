== Can I still manage legacy Compliant buckets?

The S3 Object Lock feature replaces the Compliance feature that was available in previous StorageGRID versions. If you created compliant buckets using a previous version of StorageGRID, you can continue to manage the settings of these buckets; however, you can no longer create new compliant buckets.

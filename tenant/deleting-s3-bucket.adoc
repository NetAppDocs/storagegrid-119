[.lead]
You can use the Tenant Manager to delete one or more S3 buckets that are empty.

.Before you begin

* You are signed in to the Tenant Manager using a link:../admin/web-browser-requirements.html[supported web browser].
* You belong to a user group that has the link:tenant-management-permissions.html[Manage all buckets or Root access permission]. These permissions override the permissions settings in group or bucket policies.
* The buckets you want to delete are empty. If buckets you want to delete are _not_ empty, link:../tenant/deleting-s3-bucket-objects.html[delete objects from the bucket].

.About this task

These instructions describe how to delete an S3 bucket using the Tenant Manager. You can also delete S3 buckets using the link:understanding-tenant-management-api.html[Tenant Management API] or the link:../s3/operations-on-buckets.html[S3 REST API].

You can't delete an S3 bucket if it contains objects, noncurrent object versions, or delete markers. For information about how S3 versioned objects are deleted, see link:../ilm/how-objects-are-deleted.html[How objects are deleted].

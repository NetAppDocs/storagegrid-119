If you are using an S3 tenant and you have the appropriate permission, you can delete your own S3 access keys. After an access key is deleted, it can no longer be used to access the objects and buckets in the tenant account.

.Before you begin
* You are signed in to the Tenant Manager using a link:../admin/web-browser-requirements.html[supported web browser].
* You have the link:tenant-management-permissions.html[Manage your own S3 credentials permission].

CAUTION: The S3 buckets and objects belonging to your account can be accessed using the access key ID and secret access key displayed for your account in the Tenant Manager. For this reason, protect access keys as you would a password. Rotate access keys on a regular basis, remove any unused keys from your account, and never share them with other users.

.Steps
. Select *STORAGE (S3)* > *My access keys*.

. From the My access keys page, select the checkbox for each access key you want to remove.

. Select *Delete key*.

. From the confirmation dialog box, select *Delete key*.

A confirmation message appears in the upper right corner of the page.

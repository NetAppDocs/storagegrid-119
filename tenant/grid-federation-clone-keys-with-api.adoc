If your tenant account has the *Use grid federation connection* permission, you can use the Tenant Management API to manually clone S3 access keys from the tenant on the source grid to the tenant on the destination grid.

.Before you begin

* The tenant account has the *Use grid federation connection* permission. 
* The grid federation connection has a *Connection status* of *Connected*.
* You are signed in to the Tenant Manager on the tenant's source grid using a link:../admin/web-browser-requirements.html[supported web browser].
* You belong to a user group that has the link:tenant-management-permissions.html[Manage your own S3 credentials or Root access permission].
* If you are cloning access keys for a local user, the user already exists on both grids.
+
NOTE: When you clone S3 access keys for a federated user, both the user and the S3 access keys are added to the destination tenant.

== Clone your own access keys

You can clone your own access keys if you need to access the same buckets on both grids.

.Steps
. Using the Tenant Manager on the source grid, link:creating-your-own-s3-access-keys.html[create your own access keys] and download the `.csv` file.

. From the top of the Tenant Manager, select the help icon and select *API documentation*.

. In the *s3* section, select the following endpoint:
+
`POST /org/users/current-user/replicate-s3-access-key`
+
image::../media/grid-federation-post-current-user-replicate.png[POST endpoint for replicating own access key]

. Select *Try it out*.

. In the *body* text box, replace the example entries for *accessKey* and *secretAccessKey* with the values from the *.csv* file you downloaded.
+
Be sure to retain the double quotes around each string.

. If the key will expire, replace the example entry for *expires* with the expiration date and time as a string in ISO 8601 data-time format (for example, `2024-02-28T22:46:33-08:00`). If the key will not expire, enter *null* as the value for the *expires* entry (or remove the *Expires* line and the preceding comma).


. Select *Execute*.

. Confirm that the server response code is *204*, indicating that the key was successfully cloned to the destination grid. 

== Clone another user's access keys

You can clone another user's access keys if they need to access the same buckets on both grids.

.Steps

. Using the Tenant Manager on the source grid, link:creating-another-users-s3-access-keys.html[create the other user's S3 access keys] and download the `.csv` file.

. From the top of the Tenant Manager, select the help icon and select *API documentation*.

. Obtain the user ID. You will need this value to clone the other user's access keys.

.. From the *users* section, select the following endpoint:
+
`GET /org/users`

.. Select *Try it out*.

.. Specify any parameters you want to use when looking up users. 

.. Select *Execute*.

.. Find the user whose keys you want to clone, and copy the number in the *id* field. 

. In the *s3* section, select the following endpoint:
+
`POST /org/users/{userId}/replicate-s3-access-key`
+
image::../media/grid-federation-post-other-user.png[POST endpoint for replicating another user's access key]

. Select *Try it out*.

. In the *userId* text box, paste the user ID you copied.

. In the *body* text box, replace the example entries for *example access key* and *secret access key* with the values from the *.csv* file for that user.
+
Be sure to retain the double quotes around the string.

. If the key will expire, replace the example entry for *expires* with the expiration date and time as a string in ISO 8601 data-time format (for example, `2023-02-28T22:46:33-08:00`). If the key will not expire, enter *null* as the value for the *expires* entry (or remove the *Expires* line and the preceding comma).

. Select *Execute*.

. Confirm that the server response code is *204*, indicating that the key was successfully cloned to the destination grid.

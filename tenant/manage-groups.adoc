Manage your tenant groups as needed to view, edit, or duplicate a group, and more.

.Before you begin

* You are signed in to the Tenant Manager using a link:../admin/web-browser-requirements.html[supported web browser].
* You belong to a user group that has the link:tenant-management-permissions.html[Root access permission].

== View or edit group

You can view and edit the basic information and details for each group.

.Steps

. Select *ACCESS MANAGEMENT* > *Groups*.

. Review the information provided on the Groups page, which lists basic information for all local and federated groups for this tenant account.
+
If the tenant account has the *Use grid federation connection* permission and you are viewing groups on the tenant's source grid:
+
* A banner message indicates that if you edit or remove a group, your changes will not be synced to the other grid.
+
* As needed, a banner message indicates if groups were not cloned to the tenant on the destination grid. You can <<clone-groups,retry a group clone>> that failed.

. If you want to change the group's name:

.. Select the checkbox for the group.
.. Select  *Actions* > *Edit group name*.

. View the status of the clone operation from the details page of each group you're cloning.

For additional information, see link:grid-federation-account-clone.html[Clone tenant groups and users].

== Delete one or more groups

You can delete one or more groups. Any users who belong only to a group that is deleted will no longer be able to sign in to the Tenant Manager or use the tenant account.

NOTE: If your tenant account has the *Use grid federation connection* permission and you delete a group, StorageGRID will not delete the corresponding group on the other grid. If you need to keep this information in sync, you must delete the same group from both grids.

. Select the checkbox for each group you want to delete.

. Select *Actions* > *Delete group* or *Actions* > *Delete groups*.
